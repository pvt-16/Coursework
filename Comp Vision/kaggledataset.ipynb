Encoder can be fully connected dense neural network or Convolution neural network. Encoder is used to downsample our original sample image into latent vector by passing image through Convolution layers and maxpool layer.Similary,decoder also can be fully connected neural network or Convolution neural network, decoder is used to upsample the latent vector downsampled by encoder. This upsampled latent vector is compared with the original input and reconstruction loss is calculated. Backpropagation is used to minimized this reconstruction loss. Simple autoencoder can be used for Domain transformation, denoising images, image colorization, anamoly detection etc. Here I am going to train my autoencoder model to generate sketch of the input image.  I don't have enough training images so my model mightnot generate very good sketch of image."],"metadata":{"id":"0Uazk61nx5e7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<img src = 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chitralekha_Bhat/publication/317559243/figure/fig2/AS:531269123805186@1503675837486/Deep-Autoencoder-DAE.png'>"],"metadata":{"id":"a1ZYAc1Wx5fR"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Objective:\n","To convert image to sketch using autoencoder"],"metadata":{"id":"PWkpny6ox5fU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<img src = 'https://www.seoclerk.com/pics/254019-1TRhz71407611170.jpg'>"],"metadata":{"id":"r3Jan8ELx5fY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Import Necessary Libraries"],"metadata":{"id":"w4QpJ4TGx5fa"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","import keras \n","from keras.layers import Dense, Conv2D, MaxPool2D, UpSampling2D, Dropout, Input\n","from keras.preprocessing.image import img_to_array\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import cv2\n","from tqdm import tqdm \n","import os\n","import re"],"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"id":"K8rZQKYbx5fd","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1645371449610,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":5508,"user":{"displayName":"P !","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"12288344841493109737"}}},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Load data\n","At first, I would like to thank the person who created this amazing dataset.
