            "<p> Happy new year! I feel with the turn of 2015 I should talk about my new year's resolutions. As big of a year as 2014 was, I feel like this will be even bigger. I'll be graduating for one, turning 21 for two. So I thought instead of talking about the past year, I'll talk about what I have planned for 2015 and how I seek to improve myself.\n",
            "<p> Graduating uni with a 2:1 and finding a job\n",
            "<p> SAVING SAVING SAVING MONEY\n",
            "<p> With that comes learning to drive - my dad's really been pushing me to at least do my theory for a couple of years now and I think with the end of school, it'll be the perfect time to dedicate myself to driving\n",
            "<p> Toning up - I've had really bad back pains the past few months so the least I need to be doing is pilates. But I also wanna hit the gym just to tone up and feel better about myself. I used to have very severe body image issues but having lost a lot of weight, that mostly passed, but I still have some days where I just wish I looked different and I feel like if I toned myself up, stopped being so lazy, the amount of times I get those days will decrease\n",
            "<p> That brings me to eating healthy - you guys know I'm vegan but I'm literally the most unhealthy vegan you'll come across. I live off of white rice, potatoes, veggie alternatives e.g. sausages/burgers and biscuits. I really hate vegetables but I feel like I need to teach myself to like them, just because I know I'll be feeling way better physically and I really wanna see the effect it has on my skin.\n",
            "<p> SKIN - now, my skin is pretty okay (mA mA) but I'm still prone to breakouts and I think these could really be eradicated if I buckled up and ate decent food - less eating out and more learning how to cook for myself. Also, skincare routine. I don't believe in putting a dozen products on my face but I really want to find a good moisturiser/oil and face scrub as these are the two main products I use on my face.\n",
            "<p> LEARN HOW TO COOK - I'm the only vegan in my family and I'm a terrible cook, which means my mum makes 80% of my meals and understandably she doesn't always have time to cook something separate for me if she makes a meat-centred meal so that's why I really really need to learn to survive by myself and cook, healthy, tasty vegan meals.\n",
            "<p> Visit at least one new country. When I go away, it's mostly to relatives' houses or family friends', which means either Russia or Holland. But with the end of uni, I really want to go somewhere new for a week or so in the summer, somewhere with lots and lots of sun and be a proper tourist\n",
            "<p> Brushing up on my French - I used to be a massive French enthusiastic and got pretty good grades (I learnt it for 7 years at school) but as everyone knows, once you stop using a language, you start to forget it, which has happened to me with French (and Russian) so that means more French reading, listening and speaking. I also need to brush up on my Russian - Russian is my mother tongue but I do little reading and writing so that's my main focus point - I still have Anna Karenina in Russian dusting up on my bookshelf so I need to pick that up\n",
            "<h> Monday, 29 December 2014\n",
            "<p> So, first things first, I'M BACK TO STUBS /wipes tear while violin plays in the background/ but honestly like it was time to start over, I'd gotten a bit bored n I actually always restart growing my nails in time for the new year. Cutting my nails to stubs really signifies something new to me. It makes me feel really fresh n cleansed, like beginning a new chapter. I don't know, it sounds dumb but it's true.\n",
            "<p> I decided to do something special this week because it's the new year so I went with 'Obsidian' by Models Own from their Goth collection.\n",
            "<p> Honestly, prior to using this polish, I had no idea this brand was vegan but hey it is! This shade is a gorgeous grey colour with specks of different sized silver glitter.\n",
            "<p> I was a bit wary at first cos I didn't know if the formula would be thick enough for me to get away without a base colour but after two layers I'm happy to report that it dries completely opaque. I would say it's a matte shimmer finish which I was okay with but as much as I love matte nails on other people, I don't think they suit me much so I put a topcoat on them n I love the result!\n",
            "<p> I got this shade in my monthly Birchbox but it retails for £5, which I think is a pretty fair price.\n",
            "<p> All in all, it's a gorgeous, unique colour but I'm definitely not looking forward to the removal part...\n",
            "<h> Saturday, 27 December 2014\n",
            "<p> So after the chaos of Christmas and family shenanigans, we're back! I submitted my last assignment of the semester the other day so I'm free to blog again!...(and to do my dissertation?...clearly my priorities are on point)\n",
            "<p> To be honest, my fiction reads have all been from memory so far - the last time I read a fiction book was in the summer cos uni just takes up most of my reading material so I'm gonna do a generic fictional read this week and it's /drum roll/....Agatha Christie! I absolutely LOVE her. I've read about 10-15 of her books so far and I'm slowly working through the collection. What I love about her work is that I can read a book once then go back to it in a couple of months and it feels like I'm reading a new book, like for some reason I always manage to forget the plot as soon as I finish the book so like an idiot every time I read a story for the second time I'm like getting shockers and plot twists as if it was my first time reading it. Her writing is super simple and easy to follow but the plots are so complex that you (well, me anyway) can never guess 'whodunnit'. I think out of Marple and Poirot, Miss Marple is my favourite, just cos the poor woman is underestimated every time cos she's an old lady from a village but she manages to roast the police officers every time. Fiction of the week is surprisingly, actually not a history book. It's The Bond by Wayne Pacelle. I was given this as a birthday gift a couple of years ago and it was such a great read because I was still new to veganism and I learnt a lot about the conditions of animals outside the food industry, like zoos, science labs and pet breeders. Let me just say, that I didn't go vegan because I hated the taste of meat/animal by-products. Honestly, the smell of barbecue and roasts still reels me in and I miss it a lot. I went vegan cos I realised that I can't love animals n contribute to their exploitation at the same time. Saying that, I can't recall Pacelle mentioning veganism once. He does well in informing the reader on the condition of animals but in terms of taking steps and making changes to your footprint...not a word. I'm not especially shocked, as it had a lot of popularity and people tend to like books that seem 'revolutionary' but aren't really, just so they can feel like they're doing something to fight injustice. It's okay. In terms of facts, it's great, if that's what you're looking for. If I could (I wish) I'd use it to write an essay but yeah it's not very helpful in giving advice on your next steps once you've internalised the point of the book.\n",
            "<p> I hope you guys found this helpful, merry christmas and a happy new year!\n",
            "<h> Saturday, 20 December 2014\n",
            "<p> You know when you walk into a shop, knowing that you need to grab something essential n leave...but then you end up not finding what you need n leaving the shop with something you don't need...that's me. Every time. This time I happened to be browsing B.'s range cos I've been contemplating buying a BB cream or tinted moisturiser or something just to even out my skin a bit, but something that isn't as heavy as foundation (suggestions anyone?) Anyway, their range is half price at the moment so I picked up this gem. I don't like any of their lipsticks cos they're far too shimmery for me so I had a look at the lip colours n this one caught my eye. It's in the shade 'Goji' n it's such a beautiful brown-toned red. It's like a lip crayon which is perfect for me because I prefer to just use a lip liner to colour my lips as opposed to lipstick. Usually it's retail price is £7.99 (too expensive for high street makeup in my opinion) but with the offer I got it for half price at £3.99 (acceptable). Now, it is a shimmer (boo) but it's nothing some translucent powder can't sort out. I wouldn't say the colour is anything special. I was kinda expecting it to be more of a mauve/brown toned shade but it's literally just an ordinary pink-toned red. I put this on my cheeks too n honestly, it isn't that amazing. I wouldn't have bought it without the offer and in hindsight, I don't think I should have bought it at all. Oh well, I'm sure I'll use it at some point.\n",
            "<h> Wednesday, 17 December 2014\n",
            "<p> These past few months I've been on the hunt for a perfect bronzer. Now for my NC43 skin (I'll write my foundation shades in the about me page) its hard to find the right depth and tone for my skin. A bronzer to me works as a way to give me a sun kissed glow. Not really a way to contour (though I wouldn't mind if I did found a tone that'd work for that purpose too)\n",
            "<p> I purchased the Daniel Sandler Creme Bronzer in Fiji first. Which has a red, copperish undertone to it. Its such a beautiful product. Theres a subtle shimmery sheen. Not at allll obvious (and I know when bloggers + youtubers may say not obvious but really 'I can see shimmer' but this is undetectable) it just gives off a beautiful glow.\n",
            "<p> Fiji on fair skin - Pixiwoo\n",
            "<p> Now naturally, when you go under the sun you do get flushed. No one tans 'orange'. (I really don't get why people find being stark orange beautiful but each to their own, theres no rules in makeup!) you may turn a warm brown. But when you just get out of the sun, theres that reddish flush which I find soo beautiful. Like you've just been to a tropical country, this healthy glow...no pastiness in sight\n",
            "<p> I really really like these bronzers. The consistency, pigmentation, tone and depth are just perfect. And I can see these being quite universal (really deep skin tones can use this as a blush or highlighter maybe?) I've yet to try his watercolour blushes but thats for sure on my list. I really get that Daniel Sandler makes an effort with his cosmetic line not just rebranding already done products.\n",
            "<p> So you guys know I'm not one for experimenting with makeup - once I find something I like, I literally won't try anything else until I hit the pan with the others. But, one type of product I do like to experiment with is blush n bronzer. When I'm on the go, I stick to my Milani duo, because it's small, compact and contains both blush and bronzer. But when I have spare time or I wanna make an effort this is one of the looks I go for.\n",
            "<p> Blush n bronzer are really important to me in terms of makeup cos I don't wear foundation, so I rely on them to brighten up my face and take the focus away from any blemishes. Plus, I'm a huge fan of contouring and I basically do the whole temple/cheek/jawline routine. Only thing I miss is my nose because it's skinny enough and if anything, I wish it was a lil wider.\n",
            "<p> I use Makeup Revolution's 'Ultra Bronze' (...bronzer?) (RRP £4.49) to contour n hollow out my cheeks a bit and above that Sleek's blush in 'Rose Gold', (RRP £3) using E.L.F's studio stipple brush to blend everything together. This blush is one of my favourites because the gold specs in it act as a highlighter too giving you a really dewy, glowing look. Before, when I did wear foundation, my face used to get suuuuper oily, especially my T-Zone, but it's pretty in check now, so I don't really had to worry about looking greasy. Saying that, I tried a new rosehip oil last night that came in my monthly Birchbox so that may be one of the reasons I stayed matte for so long today.\n",
            "<p> Also I thought I should add that I have Pixi's tinted shea butter lip balm on my lips in 'Ripe Raspberry'. It's superrr pigmented, n a lil goes a long way. I can't even swipe it on my lips, I have to dab cos the colour payoff is so strong and bright. The blush and bronzer you can buy online or in store in Superdrug. The lip balm I got in my October Birchbox, it's the full size and you can buy it on their site too, here.\n",
            "<h> Monday, 15 December 2014\n",
            "<p> A while back, I watched Lisa Eldrige's (makeup artist) YouTube video of a makeup tutorial on Alexa Chung. It was the look that was created for the campaign of Alexa's Eyeko range. I picked up 2 out of 3 of the Eyeko Me and My Shadow pencils(?) in Chocolate and Taupe, third shade being Charcoal.\n",
            "<p> I'm always on the look for a fuss free eyeshadow pencil that I can smudge on to my eyelid and walk out of the house. And theres plenty of these pencils on the market. I'm also on the hunt for a perfect taupe shade that DOESN'T turn silver/grey on me.\n",
            "<p> These twist up pencils come with a flat brush on one side to smudge the product. Its a great concept and it actually works. At first I thought this would be gimmicky, I mean would it actually smudge the product well? And it actually does. And as it's flat, I can build the product on the back of my hand, and dab the brush on to it and line my bottom lash line. However on my lid, I much prefer a rounder eyeshadow brush.\n",
            "<p> I really like the formula, they blend so easily and they work well on the waterline. So they are quite a soft formula, but not as soft say...like the Rimmel or the Maybelline ones. So you have quite a bit of control to it.\n",
            "<p> Eyeko Me and My Shadow in Chocolate\n",
            "<p> On the downside, I'm not that hyped about the actual colour of these. I hoped the brown would be a lot warmer. I bought them based on swatches online. But, on me, it has a greyish tinge. This probably won't happen if I applied it to Nuria, or anyone paler than me. Same with Taupe, it turned very silvery on me. Which is such a shame as I find the formula perfect.\n",
            "<p> Eyeko Me and My Shadow in Taupe\n",
            "<p> I bought these on Asos and there's a sale at the moment, so you can pick these up for £10.50 each (RRP £15)\n"

            "<h> The kids TV shows begging for a reboot\n",
            "<p> Crack out the orange soda: Kenan and Kel are getting back together to make some new material.\n",
            "<p> Now, before you go too wild, we're not getting new episodes of their self-titled '90s kids' TV classic, or their sketch show All That. Instead, the pair - embodied by actors Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell - have paired up with some former All That castmates for a sketch on the MTV comedy show, Wild'N'Out.\n",
            "<p> Looks like this post is no longer available from its original source. It might've been taken down or had its privacy settings changed.\"\n",
            "<p> Seeing the guys back together - even in a limited capacity - is making us hanker for a proper reunion between Kenan and Kel - either a TV show or, even better, a movie.\n",
            "<p> Now, before you point it out, we'd like to state we do know there already was a film, but that was made-for-TV and we want this to be a big cinema blockbuster.\n",
            "<p> The duo filled our screens from 1996 to 2000, and, basically, now we want them back.\n",
            "<p> For those who need a recap, Kenan and Kel were high-school students who were constantly getting themselves into bizarre situations. Still don't remember? Two words: Orange. Soda.\n",
            "<p> Yep, now you've got it, for some reason Kel was absolutely obsessed with the stuff, and while Kenan had a part-time job in a grocery shop, Kel would be hanging around trying to get his hands on the brightly coloured drink.\n",
            "<p> Looks like this post is no longer available from its original source. It might've been taken down or had its privacy settings changed.\"\n",
            "<p> This could form the basis of the feature-length film: a moving drama where Kenan helps cure Kel of his additive-filled drink addiction.\n",
            "<p> The other thing you could look forward to? They started each show by speaking to the live studio audience. It would only be right if the duo went to every single screening and introduced their film to the cinema-goers.\n",
            "<p> The prospect of a Kenan and Kel movie isn't as far-fetched as you might think. After all, '90s nostalgia is a big trend right now. Plus, Hollywood has already started delving into its kids TV show catalogue for big screen reboots. For instance, last year we had Power Rangers, which was an update of the cult '90s TV series, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\n",
            "<p> Remember when we all mass hallucinated a new Power Rangers movie last year\n",
            "<p> Unfortunately, many of the critics were unimpressed with the results. \"The most flabbergastingly misconceived reboot of recent years,\" said The Telegraph. And, while he didn't hate it, Mark Kermode's 5 live review wasn't much better...\n",
            "<p> Still, the movie has its fans too.\n",
            "<p> Looks like this post is no longer available from its original source. It might've been taken down or had its privacy settings changed.\"\n",
            "<p> So what if the Power Rangers rehash didn't entirely deliver? That doesn't mean that other beloved children's programmes couldn't work for modern audiences, either as TV or movie reboots. So what other classics should Hollywood consider?\n",
            "<p> Way before we spent endless hours caught in a 'cute cat YouTube loop', we spent our days watching cartoon cats going to war.\n",
            "<p> As such, it's only right we're treated to a blockbuster catfest which somehow merges the two.\n",
            "<p> Don't remember the magic of Thundercats? Well, leader of the gallant group was the muscular, flame-haired Lion-O, who also happened to have a massive magic sword...\n",
            "<p> Every time he and his trusty sidekicks - Panthro, Cheetara and Tygra - would go into battle against villains such as the evil Mumm-Ra, the sword would make an appearance with Lion-O shouting, 'Thunder, Thunder, Thundercats, hoooooooooooo!\" then the logo on his sword would glow red.\n",
            "<p> So who should star in the remake? Erm, Brad Kitt, Leonardo DiCatrio, Jennifur Lawrence etc etc.\n",
            "<p> Sister Sister\n",
            "<p> Looks like this post is no longer available from its original source. It might've been taken down or had its privacy settings changed.\"\n",
            "<p> The tale of two identical twins who didn't know each other existed until they bumped into one another in a clothes shop has feature film written all over it (though, admittedly the concept is a bit similar to The Parent Trap).\n",
            "<p> Personality wise, Tia and Tamera were polar opposites, but that didn't stop them being best friends. The strange situations they got themselves into had us hooked. As did their relationship with annoying neighbour, Roger.\n",
            "<p> Yet that wasn't the only reason we watched...\n",
            "<p> That theme tune. It was pure splendour, and you'd be singing it for days on end.\n",
            "<p> Looks like this post is no longer available from its original source. It might've been taken down or had its privacy settings changed.\"\n",
            "<p> However, in January, Tia poured cold water on the rumours that the remake was definitely happening...\n",
            "<p> Hey guys! Been seeing loads of tweets about the Sister, Sister, reunion. I hate to say it, but I have no NEW news to report to you. Sis and I have been trying to get this going as we still are, BUUUT no NEW news. Trust, you will hear it from us first if it’s a solid go:) 🙏🏽\n",
            "<p> This Australian series had it all: awesome setting (the characters live in a lighthouse); amazing characters (three children who live in said lighthouse all had distinctive personalities); and most importantly, incredible storylines.\n",
            "<p> At times it was slightly rude which made us feel edgy for watching it, but generally speaking you could expect some ghosts to appear or a bit of magic to take place.\n",
            "<p> With that in mind, the film could be a Harry Potter-esque affair with some slightly inappropriate jokes (ones that adults get, but kids don't) thrown in. Lovely.\n"

            "In the episode, the crew visit an outpost on planet M-113 to conduct routine medical exams on the residents, only to be attacked by a shapeshifting alien who kills by extracting salt from the victim's body.\n",
            "This was the first Star Trek episode to air on television, although the sixth to be filmed; it was chosen as the first of the series to be broadcast by the studio due to the horror plot. \"The Man Trap\" placed first in the timeslot with a Nielsen rating of 25.2 for the first half-hour and 24.2 for the remainder. It aired two days earlier on Canadian network CTV.\n",
            "The USS Enterprise arrives at planet M-113 to provide supplies and medical exams for the only known inhabitants of the planet, Professor Robert Crater (Alfred Ryder) and his wife Nancy (Jeanne Bal), who operate an archaeological research station there. Captain Kirk, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Leonard McCoy, and Crewman Darnell (Michael Zaslow) transport to the surface as Kirk teases McCoy about his affection for Nancy ten years earlier. They arrive in the research station, and each of the three men sees Nancy differently: McCoy as she was when he first met her, Kirk as she should look accounting for her age, and Darnell as an attractive blonde woman whom he met on a pleasure planet. When Nancy goes out to fetch her husband, she beckons Darnell to follow her.\n",
            "Professor Crater is reluctant to be examined, telling Kirk that they only require salt tablets. Before McCoy can complete the examination, they hear a scream from outside. They find Darnell dead, with red ring-like mottling on his face, a plant root in his mouth, and Nancy standing over him saying she was unable to stop Darnell from tasting the plant. On board Enterprise, Spock analyzes the plant. He confirms that it is poisonous, but that mottling is not a symptom. McCoy conducts a medical exam and, together with Spock, determines that all the salt was drained from Darnell's body. In response, Kirk transports back down to the planet with McCoy and two crewmen, Green (Bruce Watson) and Sturgeon (John Arndt). Kirk tells Professor Crater that he and his wife should stay aboard the Enterprise until they find out what killed Darnell. Crater then runs off trying to find Nancy. Nancy kills both Sturgeon and Green; their faces show the same mottling as Darnell. Nancy assumes the form of Green, and meets Kirk and McCoy. They beam back up to the ship with Sturgeon's body.\n",
            "\"Green\" roams the corridors, stalking several crew members, killing one. It shape-shifts into the form of McCoy after confirming that the real McCoy has taken a sedative to sleep. Meanwhile, Spock confirms that scans show only one person, Crater, on the planet; Kirk and Spock beam down to capture him. They find Green's body before Crater tries to frighten them away with phaser fire. After they stun him with a phaser beam, the dazed Crater reveals that the real Nancy was killed by the creature – the last member of a long-dead civilization of shape-shifters who feed on salt – a year earlier. The creature continued to take on the appearance of Nancy out of affection for Crater, and he has been feeding it, comparing it to the \"now-extinct buffalo\". Kirk informs Enterprise of the creature's intrusion, as the landing party and Crater transport back to the ship.\n",
            "Crater refuses to help them identify the creature, so Kirk orders the fake \"McCoy\" to administer truth serum. Kirk arrives in sickbay to find Crater dead and Spock injured; Spock's Vulcan blood made him incompatible with the creature's needs. Back in its \"Nancy\" form, the creature goes to McCoy's quarters. Kirk arrives with a phaser to provoke the creature into attacking. McCoy gets in the way, giving the creature the opportunity to attack Kirk. The creature reverts to its natural appearance and starts to feed on Kirk. McCoy opens fire with his phaser. The creature changes back into the shape of \"Nancy\" to plead for its life as McCoy continues firing and kills it. As Enterprise leaves orbit, Kirk comments to Spock that he was thinking about the buffalo.\n",
            "\"The Man Trap\" originated in the first pitch for Star Trek by Gene Roddenberry (pictured).\n",
            "\"The Man Trap\" appeared in Gene Roddenberry's original pitch for Star Trek as the title of a show with a different plot: the crew face several apparitions that are \"wish-fulfilment traps which become as real as flesh and blood\";[1] the traps increase in subtlety until the crew struggle to differentiate between apparition and reality.[1]Lee Erwin, who had previously worked on The Lieutenant with Roddenberry, was commissioned to produce a treatment; an outline featuring a salt-devouring vampire was handed in on April 8, 1966. Meanwhile, George Clayton Johnson had been assigned a storyline, tentatively titled \"Chicago II\", in which the crew of the Enterprise visit a planet where the culture was that of 1920s mob-era Chicago, which later evolved into \"A Piece of the Action\".[2] Johnson was hired after story editor John D. F. Black recommended him to the producers. Johnson decided to use the 1953 science fiction novel The Syndic by Cyril M. Kornbluth as the basis for the story.[3] Roddenberry felt that Johnson's treatment did not match his vision for Star Trek, but did not want to lose him entirely, and asked him to write \"The Man Trap\".[2][n 1] Erwin was paid in full for his version, and given a separate \"kill fee\" because it would not be used.[4][n 2]\n",
            "Roddenberry wanted to see more action, so the creature's ability to create apparitions was added to the script from the original pitch. Stan Robertson at NBC suggested to Roddenberry that they might wish to get medical advice over whether the draining of a chemical from a person would kill them instantly. To find out, Roddenberry asked Kellam de Forest Research,[2][6] who said that, while it had never happened in reality, a quick death would be likely.[2] Johnson suggested that the creature in \"The Man Trap\" could be the last of its species. He compared its situation to the reduction in numbers of American bison. Roddenberry found the idea intriguing.[4]\n",
            "Writer George Clayton Johnson in 2006. \"The Man Trap\" was his only Star Trek credit.\n",
            "Erwin was paid a further fee to terminate his contract, and Johnson wrote a first draft teleplay titled \"Damsel With a Dulcimer.\"[4] While writing, Johnson consulted Black, who advised him to place the creature on the Enterprise quickly to increase the pace of the episode.[7] This draft was delivered on May 23, but NBC felt that hallucinations were being overused; the same plot device had appeared in the pilot episode \"The Cage\". Johnson wrote a further draft on May 31, which reduced the number of apparitions, and was well received by Robert H. Justman.[4] Roddenberry and Justman made further tweaks; one was to restore the name \"The Man Trap\" from Erwin's original treatment,[8] another removed a scene which introduced McCoy's apprehension when using the transporter.[9] Johnson further edited the script, but complained about the change in name. After a second edit by Johnson, it was passed from Justman to story editor Black. While the former felt that the script still needed work, Black felt it was nearly ready.[8] Following Black's review, Roddenberry re-wrote the script between June 16 and 21.[10] Johnson felt this re-write had \"downgrad[ed] the story.\"[11]\n",
            "Black later said that Roddenberry removed a large part of Johnson's work, and that Johnson's original work was better than Roddenberry's edited version.[11] Johnson was pleased with the final episode, although he was concerned that viewers might not understand Star Trek after watching \"The Man Trap\" owing to differences in characterization between this episode and the rest of the series. He admitted that he did not like Spock and was concerned that the character would not be understood after this episode. Roddenberry was pleased with Johnson's work, and offered him further writing work on \"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\", which had been written by Robert Bloch. Roddenberry only wanted Johnson to \"polish\" the script;[7] Johnson, feeling he was unable to improve it without starting from scratch, turned down the offer, but expressed the desire to work on the show again. He later wrote a story outline titled \"Rock-A-Bye Baby, or Die!\" in which the Enterprise would have become a childlike sentient being who idolizes Kirk as its father.[7] This was not commissioned, so \"The Man Trap\" was Johnson's only work on the franchise.[12]\n",
            "Actors playing two of the crewmen who died on screen later appeared in other episodes of Star Trek. Michael Zaslow, seen in \"The Man Trap\" as Darnell, appeared in \"I, Mudd\", and later had a long-running role in the soap operaGuiding Light as Roger Thorpe. John Arndt appeared in four further episodes of the original series.[13]\n",
            "All previous episodes of Star Trek had overrun their filming schedules, and the producers were concerned that not enough time had been allotted to each production. Marc Daniels was recruited as director of \"The Man Trap\"; among his varied directing credits were episodes of I Love Lucy for Desilu Productions.[14][15] Pre-production began during the six scheduled filming days for \"The Enemy Within\",[13] but that episode ran long. Filming for \"The Man Trap\" commenced around 3:20 p.m. on June 22 and continued until 7:10 p.m.[16] Several futuristic-looking salt shakers were sourced for scenes in \"The Man Trap\", but due to concerns that they would not be recognized, they were instead used from \"The Man Trap\" onward as McCoy's tools in sickbay.[17]\n",
            "The first full day of filming on June 23 was predominantly shot on the set representing the bridge of the Enterprise. Two small establishing shots were postponed until the filming of the next episode. The following day, corridor scenes were filmed, as was the climactic scene featuring the creature's death. At that point, Daniels estimated that he was only a third of a day behind schedule. After a break for the weekend, production resumed on June 27 for scenes in the botany lab, the briefing room and sickbay.[18] One of Grace Lee Whitney's favorite sets to work on throughout the series was the lab, which was the sickbay redecorated, as she enjoyed working with George Takei. The animated plant in that scene was a hand puppet controlled from under the table, and Whitney later recalled that the operator could see right up her skirt throughout the shoot and would occasionally try to grope her using the puppet.[19]\n",
            "For the sickbay scenes when Spock bleeds, Daniels decided that Vulcans should have green blood.[18] Roddenberry disliked the idea and unsuccessfully attempted to have it corrected in post-production. By the end of the fifth day of shooting, Daniels estimated that he was now only half an hour behind schedule.[20] Days six and seven were spent on the sets used to show the surface of M-113; while the design of the planet did not match Johnson's vision, he was pleased with it nonetheless. The ruins were constructed out of cardboard boxes covered in gunite (a spray-on, cement-like product) to give them a rocky appearance. Production wrapped on June 30, at 2:55 p.m.[20] Bob Justman later referred to Daniels as the \"savior\" of the series for delivering \"The Man Trap\" on schedule,[14] and when the director for \"The Naked Time\" dropped out, Daniels took over and shot the episode back to back with \"The Man Trap\" a quarter of a day faster than the schedule.[14] By the end of the original series, Daniels had filmed more episodes than any other director.[19]\n",
            "During the production of \"The Man Trap\", Daniels introduced a system in which actors unneeded on a shoot went to a \"cast table\" area to practice upcoming scenes rather than return to their dressing rooms. Producers felt that this both sped up the filming process and improved the quality of performances. The cast table system continued to be used throughout the production of the original series, even when Daniels was not directing.[14]\n",
            "In post-production, Justman recommended adding an opening narration. Roddenberry agreed and wrote new lines for a Captain's log. Alexander Courage recorded the music for this episode on August 19,[21] the same day as the \"Theme from Star Trek\",[22] using a 25-piece orchestra.[21] While Roddenberry liked the theme, he hated the music created specifically for \"The Man Trap\". The optical effects were created more quickly than usual; Howard A. Anderson, Jr. took two months, three times faster than for some episodes. The overall production costs for \"The Man Trap\" came in under-budget at $185,401.[22]\n",
            "The producers spent some time considering the creature's appearance. Justman suggested to Gene Roddenberry that it could be some sort of \"terrifying, young lady\" with a similar appearance to the green skinned Orion slave girl seen in \"The Cage\", but blue skinned and with orange hair. While Roddenberry thought that the idea was good, he already had an agreement with NBC that it would be an animal.[4] Johnson envisaged the creature as a refugee with \"ashen skin\" wearing \"gunnysack clothing\".[16] Daniels had some apprehension about using a monster-of-the-week format, asking \"Do you go for cheap thrills or a more intelligent approach?\" He said that the crew decided to \"treat everything as if it were real\" in order to help the audience buy into it.[23] It was Johnson who suggested the creature should be a shapeshifter, having used the idea in an episode of The Twilight Zone he wrote called \"The Four of Us Are Dying\".[4]\n",
            "The creature was designed by Wah Chang. Dancer Sandra Gimpel wore the costume on-screen.[16] Gimpel had previously appeared as a Talosian in \"The Cage\".[24] The head of the creature costume was sculpted in clay then covered in a plaster cast. Once the cast was removed, liquid latex was applied to create a flexible single-piece mask,[25] which was then painted. Chang added a white wig and attached glass lenses to the mask for eyes. Once Gimpel was wearing the mask, cuts were made into its wrinkles to offer the actress some limited vision while wearing it. Gloves were modified by Chang to give the fingers the appearance of tentacles with suction cups. William Ware Theiss created the rest of the costume out of a fur bodysuit.[26]\n",
            "Johnson praised both Chang and Gimpel, saying that while the latter embodied the character, the design work meant that, in the final scene, it was as if the crew had to kill a \"helpless dog\".[16] After filming, the costume was kept in Justman's office, becoming the first in an ever-growing number of alien costumes accumulated there.[27] It reappeared on-screen in \"The Squire of Gothos\".[28] Although referred to officially as the \"M-113 creature\", during production it was called the \"salt sucker\" and fans of the show have taken to referring to the alien as the \"salt vampire\".[27][29]\n",
            "Don Lanning was part of the team working on the creature effects for the 2009 film Star Trek. He was the key sculptor for the production, and personally revamped some of the aliens from the original series, including the salt vampire seen in \"The Man Trap\". He described the original design as \"hokey\",[30] and said that he tried to change it to \"something organic\".[30] The new version of the creature was unused in the film, which pleased Lanning.[30] The creature did return in Star Trek Online, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Rather than a single salt vampire, the 20-player PvE mission \"Mine Trap\" saw a Romulan colony overrun with them.[31] A salt vampire also makes an appearance in an episode of the animated series Star Trek: Lower Decks. In December 2019, an animated version of the creature made a brief appearance in the opening scenes of the Star Trek Short: Trek episode \"Ephraim and Dot\".\n",
            "Paula M. Block and Terry J. Erdmann wrote that Dr. McCoy (pictured) would have been troubled for some time after the death of the creature at his hands.\n",
            "In his book The Influence of Star Trek on Television, Film and Culture, Lincoln Geraghty wrote that episodes such as \"The Man Trap\" demonstrated a recurring theme within the series: the more barren the planet, the more likely that characters will be in danger. Other episodes which he said supported this view included \"The Cage\" and \"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\".[32] Geraghty also pointed out that elsewhere in the original series, the predominant view was that alien predators such as the salt vampire were a lower life form which should be destroyed. He said that in \"The Man Trap\", the alternative argument is presented: that such creatures should not be killed. However, Geraghty felt that the writers tried to prevent viewers from feeling sympathy for the creature by revealing its true appearance as it died.[33] Paula M. Block and Terry J. Erdmann also discussed the killing of the creature in their book Star Trek: The Original Series 365, saying that it was \"the right thing to do\", but suggested that the nature of the death would have troubled McCoy for some time after the event although this was not shown in the series.[34]\n",
            "Block and Erdmann also discussed another part of the episode where Spock is in charge on the bridge and Uhura begins to flirt with him, calling it a \"quintessential scene of the series\" due to the characters' sexual interest in each other.[37] They suggested this may have been the inspiration for the Spock/Uhura relationship introduced in the 2009 reboot film Star Trek.[37]Nichelle Nichols, who played Uhura, later said that she felt there were hints of an Uhura/Spock relationship in other episodes of the original series.[38]\n",
            "A month prior to the premiere of Star Trek, Desilu held a screening for NBC executives to help decide which episode to broadcast first, and several stories were considered.[39] Executives were concerned that \"Mudd's Women\", one potential choice, would have reviewers discussing \"space hookers\"; they felt another possibility, \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\", contained too much exposition, even though it was filmed as a second pilot. The final choice was between \"The Man Trap\" and \"The Naked Time\".[39] Justman felt that \"The Naked Time\" would make it easier for viewers to understand the characters, but later agreed with NBC's decision to show \"The Man Trap\" first. In the book Inside Star Trek: The Real Story, he suggests that it was \"scarier and more exploitable than the others\".[39]\n",
            "\"The Man Trap\" was the sixth episode produced. Although Roddenberry initially disagreed with NBC's decision, he and production executive Herbert Franklin Solow came to believe it was the correct choice.[39][40] Shatner also disagreed with the network, feeling that \"The Man Trap\" was the worst episode out of those available.[40] The episode was the first episode of Star Trek broadcast in the United States, on NBC on September 8, 1966.[41] \"The Man Trap\" formed part of NBC's \"Sneak a Peek Week\", in which the network showed the premiere episodes of several new shows in prime time slots, ahead of the rival channels ABC and CBS, who were still showing repeats from the previous season. Leading into Star Trek was the first episode of Tarzan showing Ron Ely, and leading out was Richard Mulligan's The Hero.[42]\n",
            "\"The Man Trap\" placed first in its timeslot, with Nielsen ratings of 25.2 during the first half-hour; some 46.7 percent of all televisions in use at the time were tuned in to the episode.[41] In the same timeslot, The Tammy Grimes Show on ABC and My Three Sons on CBS received ratings of 14.1 and 9.4 respectively. During the second half of the episode, the rating for \"The Man Trap\" dropped to 24.2, with 42.2 percent of televisions tuned in. Bewitched on ABC increased that network's rating to 15.8, and CBS's Thursday night movie increased their rating to 10.7.[41]\n",
            "The following episodes saw a drop in ratings after \"The Man Trap\". \"Charlie X\" was broadcast the following week; the studio did not want that episode to run second, but \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\" was the only other completed story. It placed second in the timeslot during the first half hour, with a rating of 19.1 and an overall share of 35.9 percent of viewers. It was beaten by My Three Sons on CBS with a rating of 19.2. During the second half hour, Star Trek was pushed into third with a rating of 12.3 by the Thursday night movie on CBS and the season premiere of Bewitched, which was also the first episode of that series broadcast in color.[43] The following week, with \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\", the series returned to the top place with a 19.9 rating during the first half hour, and second in the second half hour to Bewitched. The Trendex rating report for the first few weeks of Star Trek saw it ranked in 33rd spot for the period with an average rating of 18.7.[44]\n",
            "The episode was not the first to be broadcast in the United Kingdom, which instead premiered Star Trek on BBC One with \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\" on July 12, 1969. The episodes continued to be broadcast in a different order than they had appeared in the United States. \"The Man Trap\" was shown nearly three months later on October 4 as the 13th episode. This was during the period when the channel was still broadcasting only in black and white; it was not until \"Arena\" on November 15 that the series was shown in color. During subsequent repeats of Star Trek, the channel reverted to NBC's schedule and showed \"The Man Trap\" as the first episode.[45] Canadian network CTV aired episodes of the first season of Star Trek on Tuesday nights instead of Thursdays and so ran \"The Man Trap\" on September 6, 1966, two days before NBC.[46] Airing American programs early was a common practice among Canadian broadcasters in order to avoid direct competition for viewers and advertisers with American border stations airing the same program at the same time. The practice became obsolete once simultaneous substitution of commercials was permitted.[47]\n",
            "A high-definition remastering of \"The Man Trap\", which introduced new special effects and starship exteriors as well as enhanced music and audio, was shown for the first time in the United States on September 29, 2007, in broadcast syndication.[48] The episode was made available to over 200 local stations across the United States with the rights to broadcast Star Trek.[49]\n",
            "In the 1966, The Hollywood Reporter said the episode was a \"winner\", with a lot of suspense and science fiction gadgets.[50]\n",
            "In an interview published in the 1988 book The Star Trek Interview Book, Johnson claimed that the response of critics to \"The Man Trap\", and the initial episodes of Star Trek in general, was \"complete bewilderment\".[7] In previewing the broadcast of \"The Man Trap\", The Daily Reporter said that Star Trek had the \"usual far-fetched suppositions\" present in other science fiction works, but praise was given to the acting skills of Shatner and the plots of the initial episodes.[51] The Edwardsville Intelligencer called the reveal of the creature in the episode \"the kicker of a great sci-fi plot\".[52]Daily Variety columnist Jack Hellman gave the episode an unfavorable review over its \"lack of meaningful cast leads\", who \"move around with directorial precision with only violence to provide the excitement.\"[42] The weekly edition of the magazine offered a similar opinion, stating that the Enterprise \"trudged along for a long hour with hardly any relief from violence, killing, ugly stuff and a distasteful monster\".[41]\n",
            "Among more recent reviews, Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an \"A-\" rating, describing it as \"done very well\" with a plot that is dark and ambiguous.[53] Torrie Atkinson and Eugene Myers reviewed the episode in 2009 for Tor.com, saying that it suitably introduced the characters, although certain elements of the show were not yet in place. These included the lack of the death of a redshirted character, as the crewmen who died in \"The Man Trap\" did not wear red shirts, along with the lack of red and yellow alerts, instead referred to as general quarters three and four in this episode. The duo added that the episode demonstrated that the series was \"something special\", and that it remained more culturally diverse than modern television. They gave it a rating of four out of six.[54]\n",
            "Ryan Britt, also writing for Tor.com, said that \"The Man Trap\" was not a good introduction to the series, but praised the screen time given to Rand, Uhura and Sulu. He added that the latter two were more interesting in this episode than they would be at any point until the start of the movie franchise. Britt said that \"The Man Trap\" was different than the rest of the series, and more akin to The Twilight Zone owing to the background of the writer.[55] In Hollywood.com's ranking of all 79 episodes of The Original Series, Christian Blauvelt placed \"The Man Trap\" as 73rd, calling the creature \"incredibly pointless\".[56] It was also listed as one of the show's \"cheesiest classic creatures\" by Wired magazine in 2007;[57] however, Rolling Stone magazine listed it as the tenth best villain in the franchise.[58]\n",
            "The Guardian noted \"The Man Trap\" as an episode about a salt-eating shape-shifter, on the 50th anniversary of Star Trek's first public broadcast in 2016.[59]\n",
            "In 2018, PopMatters ranked this the 7th best episode of the original series.[60]\n",
            "Star Trek news site Trek.Report gave the episode a ranking of 3 of 5, noting that actions of the crew were not affected by the \"Prime Directive\", a later addition to the franchise's canon.[61]\n",
            "The first adaptation of \"The Man Trap\" was as a re-working into a short story by author James Blish as part of the novelization Star Trek. This book contained seven short stories, each based on an episode of The Original Series, and was published in January 1967. The adaptation of \"The Man Trap\" appeared as the third story in the book, although it was named \"The Unreal McCoy\".[62] The first home media release of \"The Man Trap\" was on Compact Cassette from Startone Productions in 1982.[63] A further release on LaserDisc took place in 1985, alongside \"Charlie X\".[64] Further releases of all episodes of the series were made on VHS and Betamax.[65][66]\n",
            "The episode was released on DVD paired with \"The Naked Time\" as part of the general release of the series in 1999.[67] There were no other extras added to that series of releases, except the DVD containing \"Turnabout Intruder\".[68][n 3] \"The Man Trap\" was later released within a DVD box set of the first season in 2004;[69] all three seasons of The Original Series were released as full-season box sets that year.[68] The episode was included in the remastered season one release on DVD and Blu-ray in 2009.[70]\n",

            "The USS Enterprise arrives at planet M-113 to provide supplies and medical exams for the only known inhabitants of the planet, Professor Robert Crater (Alfred Ryder) and his wife Nancy (Jeanne Bal), who operate an archaeological research station there. Captain Kirk, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Leonard McCoy, and Crewman Darnell (Michael Zaslow) transport to the surface as Kirk teases McCoy about his affection for Nancy ten years earlier. They arrive in the research station, and each of the three men sees Nancy differently: McCoy as she was when he first met her, Kirk as she should look accounting for her age, and Darnell as an attractive blonde woman whom he met on a pleasure planet. When Nancy goes out to fetch her husband, she beckons Darnell to follow her.\n",
            "Professor Crater is reluctant to be examined, telling Kirk that they only require salt tablets. Before McCoy can complete the examination, they hear a scream from outside. They find Darnell dead, with red ring-like mottling on his face, a plant root in his mouth, and Nancy standing over him saying she was unable to stop Darnell from tasting the plant. On board Enterprise, Spock analyzes the plant. He confirms that it is poisonous, but that mottling is not a symptom. McCoy conducts a medical exam and, together with Spock, determines that all the salt was drained from Darnell's body. In response, Kirk transports back down to the planet with McCoy and two crewmen, Green (Bruce Watson) and Sturgeon (John Arndt). Kirk tells Professor Crater that he and his wife should stay aboard the Enterprise until they find out what killed Darnell. Crater then runs off trying to find Nancy. Nancy kills both Sturgeon and Green; their faces show the same mottling as Darnell. Nancy assumes the form of Green, and meets Kirk and McCoy. They beam back up to the ship with Sturgeon's body.\n",
            "\"Green\" roams the corridors, stalking several crew members, killing one. It shape-shifts into the form of McCoy after confirming that the real McCoy has taken a sedative to sleep. Meanwhile, Spock confirms that scans show only one person, Crater, on the planet; Kirk and Spock beam down to capture him. They find Green's body before Crater tries to frighten them away with phaser fire. After they stun him with a phaser beam, the dazed Crater reveals that the real Nancy was killed by the creature – the last member of a long-dead civilization of shape-shifters who feed on salt – a year earlier. The creature continued to take on the appearance of Nancy out of affection for Crater, and he has been feeding it, comparing it to the \"now-extinct buffalo\". Kirk informs Enterprise of the creature's intrusion, as the landing party and Crater transport back to the ship.\n",
            "Crater refuses to help them identify the creature, so Kirk orders the fake \"McCoy\" to administer truth serum. Kirk arrives in sickbay to find Crater dead and Spock injured; Spock's Vulcan blood made him incompatible with the creature's needs. Back in its \"Nancy\" form, the creature goes to McCoy's quarters. Kirk arrives with a phaser to provoke the creature into attacking. McCoy gets in the way, giving the creature the opportunity to attack Kirk. The creature reverts to its natural appearance and starts to feed on Kirk. McCoy opens fire with his phaser. The creature changes back into the shape of \"Nancy\" to plead for its life as McCoy continues firing and kills it. As Enterprise leaves orbit, Kirk comments to Spock that he was thinking about the buffalo.\n",

Captain Kirk, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Leonard McCoy, and Crewman Darnell (Michael Zaslow) transport to the surface as Kirk teases McCoy about his affection for Nancy ten years earlier. They arrive in the research station, and each of the three men sees Nancy differently: McCoy as she was when he first met her, Kirk as she should look accounting for her age, and Darnell as an attractive blonde woman whom he met on a pleasure planet. When Nancy goes out to fetch her husband, she beckons Darnell to follow her.\\nProfessor Crater is reluctant to be examined, telling Kirk that they only require salt tablets. Before McCoy can complete the examination, they hear a scream from outside. They find Darnell dead, with red ring-like mottling on his face, a plant root in his mouth, and Nancy standing over him saying she was unable to stop Darnell from tasting the plant. On board Enterprise, Spock analyzes the plant. He confirms that it is poisonous, but that mottling is not a symptom. McCoy conducts a medical exam and, together with Spock, determines that all the salt was drained from Darnell's body. In response, Kirk transports back down to the planet with McCoy and two crewmen, Green (Bruce Watson) and Sturgeon (John Arndt). Kirk tells Professor Crater that he and his wife should stay aboard the Enterprise until they find out what killed Darnell. Crater then runs off trying to find Nancy. Nancy kills both Sturgeon and Green; their faces show the same mottling as Darnell. Nancy assumes the form of Green, and meets Kirk and McCoy. They beam back up to the ship with Sturgeon's body.\\n\\\"Green\\\" roams the corridors, stalking several crew members, killing one. It shape-shifts into the form of McCoy after confirming that the real McCoy has taken a sedative to sleep. Meanwhile, Spock confirms that scans show only one person, Crater, on the planet; Kirk and Spock beam down to capture him. They find Green's body before Crater tries to frighten them away with phaser fire. After they stun him with a phaser beam, the dazed Crater reveals that the real Nancy was killed by the creature \\u2013 the last member of a long-dead civilization of shape-shifters who feed on salt \\u2013 a year earlier. The creature continued to take on the appearance of Nancy out of affection for Crater, and he has been feeding it, comparing it to the \\\"now-extinct buffalo\\\". Kirk informs Enterprise of the creature's intrusion, as the landing party and Crater transport back to the ship.\\nCrater refuses to help them identify the creature, so Kirk orders the fake \\\"McCoy\\\" to administer truth serum. Kirk arrives in sickbay to find Crater dead and Spock injured; Spock's Vulcan blood made him incompatible with the creature's needs. Back in its \\\"Nancy\\\" form, the creature goes to McCoy's quarters. Kirk arrives with a phaser to provoke the creature into attacking. McCoy gets in the way, giving the creature the opportunity to attack Kirk. The creature reverts to its natural appearance and starts to feed on Kirk. McCoy opens fire with his phaser. The creature changes back into the shape of \\\"Nancy\\\" to plead for its life as McCoy continues firing and kills it. As Enterprise leaves orbit, Kirk comments to Spock that he was thinking about the buffalo.\\n\"\n",

For fourteen years, 17 year old Charlie grew up there alone, stranded in the wreckage, learning how to talk from the ship's computer systems, which remained intact.  Charlie is to be transported to his nearest relatives on the colony Alpha V.  Crew members aboard Antares speak praises about Charlie, but seem pleased to see him removed from their ship.  He tells Dr. McCoy the crew of Antares did not like him very much, and that all he wants is for people to like him.\\nDespite his eagerness to please, Charlie becomes obnoxious since his lack of upbringing has left him with no knowledge of social norms or control of his emotions.  He latches on to Captain Kirk as a father figure and develops an infatuation with Yeoman Janice Rand.  He demonstrates extraordinary powers of telepathy and matter transmutation, though the crew initially fail to recognize the cause.  Charlie meets Rand in the recreation room, where Mr. Spock plays a Vulcan lyrette and Lt. Uhura suddenly starts singing.  Charlie is annoyed with being a subject in Uhura's performance, as well as with Rand paying more attention to the song than to him, so he causes Uhura to temporarily lose her voice and Spock's instrument to malfunction.\\nWhen the Antares is nearly out of sensor range, it transmits a message to the Enterprise.  The message is cut off before it can convey a warning.  Scanners show the Antares has been reduced to debris.\\nKirk tries to teach Charlie martial arts. Sam, Kirk's training partner, laughs at one of Charlie's falls, and Charlie makes him \\\"vanish\\\".  Shocked, Kirk calls for security guards to escort Charlie to his quarters.  Charlie makes all phasers on the ship disappear, but ultimately yields to Kirk's order that he return to his quarters.  Records show that Charlie's abilities are the same as those of Thasians, but the medical examination McCoy conducted when Charlie came on board confirmed that he is human.  Charlie admits he used his powers to remove a vital component of the Antares.  Frustrated at the adversarial turn in his relationship with the crew, Charlie breaks out of his quarters and begins to use his powers on the crew-changing their phyiscal forms or freezing them according to his whim.  When Rand resists his romantic advances, he makes her \\\"disappear.\\\" When Kirk demands to know if Rand is dead or alive, Charlies refuses to tell him.\\nRealizing Charlie's powers are too great to be controlled, Kirk opts to divert from Alpha V so as to at least keep Charlie away from a civilized world, where he would wreak havoc.  Charlie discovers Kirk's plans, and takes control of the Enterprise.  Speculating that controlling the Enterprise may sap Charlie's power, Kirk orders all of the ship's systems to be activated and attacks Charlie. Though his hypothesis proves incorrect, it distracts Charlie from fleeing a Thasian Ship that had been pursuing them.\\nA Thasian ship approaches and restores the Enterprise and its crew to their proper forms -although they admit they cannot restore the Antares.  The Thasian commander says that his race gave Charlie his powers so he could survive on their world, but these powers (which they can't remove from him) make him too dangerous to live among humans.  Charlie begs Kirk to not let the aliens have him, since the Thasians lack any physical form or capacity for love.  However, the Thasians reject Kirk's argument that Charlie belongs with his own kind, and with a final echoing wail of \\\"I wanna stay!\\\" Charlie is transported away and Yeoman Rand begins crying.\\n\"\n",

Its record is incomplete, but it reveals that the Valiant had been swept from its path by a \\\"magnetic space storm,\\\" and that the crew had frantically searched for information about extrasensory perception (ESP) in the ship's library computer. The recording ends with the captain of the Valiant apparently giving a self-destruct order.\\nCaptain Kirk decides that they need to know what happened to the Valiant, and the Enterprise crosses the edge of the galaxy. There, it encounters a strange barrier which damages the ship's systems and warp drive, forcing a retreat. At the same time, nine crew members are killed and both helmsman Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood) and the ship's psychiatrist Dr. Elizabeth Dehner (Sally Kellerman) are knocked unconscious by the barrier's effect. When he awakens, Mitchell's eyes glow silver, and he begins to display remarkable psychic powers.\\nMitchell becomes increasingly arrogant and hostile toward the rest of the crew, declaring that he has become godlike, enforcing his desires with displays of telepathic and telekinetic power. Science Officer Spock comes to believe that the Valiant crew members might have experienced the same phenomenon, and destroyed their ship to keep the power from spreading. He advises Kirk that Mitchell may have to be killed before his powers develop further, but Kirk angrily disagrees.\\nAlarmed that Mitchell might take over the Enterprise, Kirk decides to maroon him at a completely automated lithium-cracking facility on the remote planet of Delta Vega. Once there, the landing party tries to confine Mitchell, but his powers have become too great. He kills navigator Lee Kelso and escapes by knocking out Kirk and Spock, taking with him Dr. Dehner, who has now developed ESP powers of her own.\\nKirk follows and appeals to Dr. Dehner's humanity for help.

Tormolen removes his environmental suit glove to scratch his nose and comes in contact with a strange red liquid. The landing party is beamed back to the ship and examined by Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy. McCoy finds no medical issues with them and allows them to return to duty.\\nWhile having lunch, Tormolen begins to act irrationally, expressing hostility towards other crew members, and threatening Lieutenants Sulu and Riley with a knife before turning it on himself. His wound is not life-threatening, but in sick bay he dies after a successful surgery, to McCoy's bewilderment.\\nBoth Sulu and Riley also begin to behave irrationally. Sulu runs about with a sword, like a swashbuckler from The Three Musketeers, while Riley revels in his Irish ancestry, locks himself in the engineering section, and proclaims himself captain of the Enterprise. Those whose skin they have touched follow suit, and the infection quickly spreads through the crew. As they abandon their posts, the ship's orbit destabilizes and it falls into the planet's erratic gravity well.

It will be impossible to restart them by normal procedures before the Enterprise crashes into the planet.\\nSpock becomes infected when Nurse Chapel takes his hands and confesses her love for him. Spock struggles to contain his emotions, and infects Captain James T. Kirk when he tries to help. McCoy studies blood samples from his patients and water from Psi 2000 and finds that the water from the planet possesses a previously undetected complex chain of molecules that affects humanoids like alcohol, depressing the centers of judgment and self-control, and is transmitted by touch.

This is suggested by a theory postulating a relationship between time and antimatter, but it has never before been attempted.

The transporter equipment appears to be fine but he notices some magnetic dust from ore samples covering Fisher's uniform that may have interfered with the transport.\\nCaptain Kirk transports back to the ship. The transporter appears to work correctly, but Kirk experiences some disorientation, and Scott escorts Kirk out of the transporter room. While unsupervised, the transporter activates a second time, materializing a second version of Kirk which behaves more maliciously than his counterpart.

Scott surmises that the ore dust has caused the transporter to split the personalities of those they beamed up, creating good and evil counterparts. Scott reports this to Mr. Spock and then orders the transporter taken out of service to investigate, stranding the landing party on the planet as the bitterly cold night sets in. Elsewhere on the ship, the \\\"good\\\" Kirk begins to feel uncertain, and struggles to make decisions. The \\\"evil\\\" Kirk, in a drunken state, sexually assaults Yeoman Janice Rand in her quarters. She scratches his face with her fingernails. When Fisher witnesses this and calls security, the \\\"evil\\\" Kirk attacks and knocks him out. Rand reports the incident to the bridge. The \\\"good\\\" Kirk orders the crew to capture the \\\"evil\\\" Kirk, but at Spock's advice he keeps the fact that their quarry is his evil half a secret so as not to weaken the crew's faith in him; the crew are instead told of an imposter recognizable by the scratches on his cheek.\\nThe \\\"evil\\\" Kirk hears this announcement and uses makeup to mask his injury. He secures a phaser from a security officer, before going into hiding in engineering. Putting himself in his shoes, the \\\"good\\\" Kirk anticipates this move. While the two Kirks scuffle, Spock disables the \\\"evil\\\" Kirk with a Vulcan nerve pinch. Spock and McCoy recognize that both Kirks are mentally deteriorating, and they must find a way to reverse the transporter accident to save them, as well as the landing party. Spock and Scott use power from the ship's impulse drive to reverse the transporter on the dog-like specimen. When it materializes, the creature is whole but dead. Spock suggests that it died because its animal brain could not handle the stress of its two halves being reintegrated, so Kirk will be able to survive the same procedure, while Dr. Leonard McCoy insists they can't take the risk that the death was caused by ongoing transporter malfunction.\\nWith the landing party nearly dead from hypothermia, the \\\"good\\\" Kirk opts to gamble on the procedure rather than wait for an autopsy on the creature. When he releases the \\\"evil\\\" Kirk, his other self overpowers him, and gives him facial scratches like his own. Pretending to be the \\\"good\\\" Kirk, he tells Rand the truth about the \\\"imposter\\\", and makes a date with her before heading to the bridge. He orders the crew to leave orbit, telling the navigator that the landing party cannot be saved. The \\\"good\\\" Kirk and McCoy race to the bridge, where the two Kirks face off. The \\\"good\\\" Kirk at last persuades the \\\"evil\\\" Kirk that they need each other to survive, and will both live on as parts of each other. He orders Scott to attempt the reversal process, and Kirk is rejoined as one being. With his sense of command and good will restored (and the transporter repaired), Kirk orders the landing party beamed up. They are safe despite the cold.

The women are intended as wives for settlers on the planet Ophiuchus III and are introduced as Ruth Bonaventure, Eve McHuron, and Magda Kovacs.

The hearing ends as the final lithium crystal fails.\\nWithout lithium crystals, the Enterprise must limp on reserve power to the storm-plagued planet Rigel XII to obtain new crystals from the miners there. Ben Childress, the chief miner, having been in contact with Mudd, demands his release along with the women in exchange for the crystals. The Enterprise's remaining power is insufficient to maintain the ship's orbit for more than a few days, threatening a fiery reentry into the planet's atmosphere, so Kirk is forced to allow Mudd and the women to beam down to the planet.

As Childress confronts Mudd over the deception, Eve snatches a dose of what appears to be the Venus Drug, but is in fact a placebo. This restores her self-confidence to the point that Childress finds her as attractive as before. Pleased, he gives Kirk the replacement crystals.

Kirk transports down to the colony with one of the ship's psychiatrists, Dr. Helen Noel.\\nAdams introduces them to a strangely emotionless therapist, Lethe, and gives Kirk and Noel a tour of the colony. Although he is affable and accommodating, his staff, like Lethe, all seem lacking in affect. Adams shows Kirk and Noel the treatment device he referred to: a \\\"neural neutralizer\\\". He claims that the machine, harmless at low intensity, is used only to calm agitated inmates. Noel is satisfied with his explanation, but Kirk remains suspicious.\\nOn the Enterprise van Gelder becomes increasingly frantic, warning that the landing party is in danger, but when he tries to explain the danger and refers to the neural neutralizer, he is convulsed with pain. Spock mind-melds with van Gelder to enable him to tell his story. Spock learns that the neural neutralizer can empty a mind of thoughts, leaving only an unbearable feeling of loneliness, and that Adams has been using it on inmates and staff to gain total control of their minds. The first officer assembles a security team, but the colony's force field blocks transport and communication.\\nUnaware of events on the ship, Kirk decides to test the neutralizer on himself, with Noel at the controls. She finds that she can easily implant thoughts into Kirk's mind, even altering his memory of a recent Christmas-party encounter between the two of them. Adams appears, overpowers Noel, seizes the controls, increases the neutralizer's intensity, and proceeds to convince Kirk that he has been madly in love with Noel for years. Kirk and Noel are then confined to quarters.\\nOn Kirk's orders, Noel enters the facility's physical plant through a ventilation duct, and interrupts Kirk's next neutralizer session by shutting off power to the entire complex. Freed from the neutralizer, Kirk attacks Adams, leaving him alone and unconscious in the treatment room. A guard discovers Noel's sabotage, they fight and she defeats him by sending him hurtling into the electric circuitry with an athletic kick. With the force field now off, Spock beams down to the planet, disables the force field, and restores power to the colony. This reactivates the neural neutralizer, which empties Adams' mind completely, killing him.\\nBack on the Enterprise, Kirk is informed that van Gelder has destroyed the neural neutralizer. McCoy is surprised that loneliness could be lethal, but Kirk, after his experience, is not.\\n\"\n",

Dave Bailey spots a large spinning multi-colored cube floating in space. He advocates attacking it with phasers. Kirk instead orders the ship to back away from the object. The cube pursues them, emitting harmful radiation, and Kirk reluctantly destroys it.\\nAs Kirk is having lunch in his quarters, a gigantic glowing sphere approaches the Enterprise, filling the bridge viewscreen even at low magnification. Commander Balok identifies his ship as the Fesarius, the flagship of the \\\"First Federation\\\", explaining that the destroyed cube was a border marker. Balok ignores Kirk's greetings and announces that he will destroy the Enterprise for trespassing into First Federation territory and destroying the marker buoy. He gives the crew ten minutes to pray to their deities. First Officer Spock obtains a visual of Balok, a blue-skinned humanoid with constantly shifting facial features. Bailey succumbs to hysteria, and Kirk orders him off the bridge. Dr. McCoy rebukes Kirk, arguing that Bailey's outburst was a result of Kirk putting too much pressure on him, and pointing out that he warned Kirk of Bailey's condition ahead of time. The argument inspires Kirk to try bluffing Balok. He tells Balok that the Enterprise contains \\\"corbomite\\\", a substance that automatically destroys any attacker, and claims he has little regard for the fact that the Enterprise would also be destroyed in the exchange. While Kirk awaits a response, Bailey asks permission to resume his duties, which Kirk grants. Balok demands proof of corbomite's existence, but when Kirk refuses, he does not destroy the Enterprise. Instead, a small tug ship detaches from the Fesarius and tows the Enterprise deep into First Federation space, where Balok states he will intern the crew and destroy the Enterprise. Intuiting that the tug ship's tractor beam cannot be as powerful as that of the Fesarius, Kirk orders the Enterprise to engage the engines at right angles to their course. Just as its engines are about to explode from overload, the Enterprise breaks free. This apparently disables the alien vessel, as the crew picks up a distress call which its mother ship does not answer.\\nThough recognizing this may be a trap, Kirk, McCoy, and Bailey form a boarding party to render assistance. They beam over and discover that the \\\"Balok\\\" on their monitor was an effigy (creature design by Wah Chang). The real Balok, looking like a hyperintelligent human child, enthusiastically welcomes them aboard. He explains that he was merely testing the Enterprise and its crew to discover their true intentions. As Kirk and company relax, Balok expresses a desire to learn more about humans and their culture, and suggests they allow a member of their crew to remain on his ship as an emissary of the Federation. Bailey happily volunteers, and Balok gives them a tour of his ship.\\n\"\n",

Leighton's true motivation, however, is his suspicion that Anton Karidian, the leader of a Shakespearean acting troupe currently on the planet, is in fact Kodos the Executioner, former governor of the Earth colony of Tarsus IV. Kodos had ordered that half the population of 8000 be put to death during a food shortage (supply ships were late and it was believed the full population would not survive until they arrived). Both Leighton and Kirk were eyewitnesses. Kirk insists Kodos is dead, but reconsiders after researching Karidian's background. Hoping to meet Karidian at a party at Leighton's home, Kirk meets his daughter Lenore. During a walk outside, the two find Leighton dead.\\nKirk arranges for the Enterprise to ferry the acting troupe to its next destination. He transfers Lt. Kevin Riley to Engineering, after discovering that he, too, was a witness to the Tarsus IV massacre. These actions arouse the curiosity of First Officer Spock who, after an investigation of his own, learns the history of the massacre, Kirk and Riley's connection to it, and that seven of the nine witnesses to the massacre have died, in each case when Karidian's troupe was somewhere nearby.\\nRiley is poisoned, and a phaser set on overload is left in Kirk's quarters. Kirk confronts Karidian with his suspicions. Karidian does not admit to being Kodos, but argues in defense of Kodos's actions, and when asked to read a transcript of Kodos's execution order, does so with barely a glance at the paper. A computer analysis of his voice results in a near-perfect match with Kodos, but Kirk still hesitates to accuse Karidian.\\nLt. Riley, recovering in sickbay, overhears Dr. McCoy's log entry and learns that Karidian is suspected of being Kodos. Riley heads for the ship's theater, where the Karidian troupe is performing Hamlet, and goes backstage, phaser in hand, to exact revenge for the death of his family. Kirk discovers him before he can act, and persuades him to surrender the weapon. Karidian, overhearing, is disturbed, and Lenore tries to reassure him by revealing that she has been killing the witnesses to his crimes. Kirk, overhearing this conversation, moves to arrest them both. Lenore snatches a phaser from a security guard and aims at Kirk. Karidian jumps into the line of fire, is hit, and dies. Lenore breaks down and begs her father to wake up and continue his performance. Later, on the bridge, McCoy reports on her psychiatric condition; she believes her father is still alive and giving performances to cheering crowds.\\n\"\n",

The Enterprise comes to Outpost 4's aid and contacts the base commander, Hansen, who reveals he is the only survivor of an attack by an unknown enemy. As they speak, the enemy ship reappears, fires, and disappears. The shot destroys the outpost and kills Hansen.\\nThe ship's sensors locate the attacker, which remains invisible.

Lieutenant Stiles, the navigator, son of a service family that lost several members in the Earth\\u2013Romulan War, begins to question the loyalty of the Enterprise's first officer, Mr. Spock.\\nDuring a discussion of the Romulan ship's capabilities, Stiles suggests the Enterprise attack before it can reach the Neutral Zone. Spock agrees; he reasons that if the Romulans are in fact an offshoot of the Vulcan species and have retained the martial philosophy of the Vulcans' ancient past, they would surely take advantage of any perceived weakness.\\nA cat-and-mouse game ensues. The Enterprise is faster and more maneuverable, while the Romulan ship has a cloaking device and immensely destructive plasma torpedoes.

When Spock advises against it, Boma becomes insubordinate, to which Spock responds by allowing him the funeral.  During the ceremony, the creatures attack again, and Spock is pinned by a boulder.  Despite Spock's orders to leave him, McCoy and Boma free him.  Spock then manages to get the Galileo off the ground by using the shuttle's boosters. As a result, the shuttle now has too little fuel to escape the planet's gravity or even to achieve a stable orbit, and there is still no way to contact the Enterprise. Spock suddenly decides to dump and ignite all the remaining fuel from the shuttle's engines. The giant flare he produces is seen on the Enterprise view screen just as the ship has left orbit.

To test this theory, Kirk provokes Trelane into a duel, and during the fight, he destroys the mirror and damages some strange machinery inside. The bridge crew then beams back to the Enterprise, but as the ship attempts to warp away, the planet Gothos keeps appearing in its path. Kirk finally orders the Enterprise into orbit and decides to beam down.\\nOn the planet, Kirk finds Trelane seated on a courtroom bench, dressed in the white wig and robes reminiscent of an English circuit judge. Trelane reads charges of \\\"treason\\\", \\\"conspiracy\\\", and \\\"fomenting insurrection\\\", and then, silencing Kirk's protests, condemns Kirk to death by hanging. Kirk, however, points out that Trelane could find a more stimulating alternative. Trelane suggests that Kirk be prey for a royal hunt, and Kirk agrees in return for the release of his ship. The hunt begins, and Kirk is eventually cornered at the castle entrance, but remains defiant. Suddenly two energy beings appear and call out to Trelane, ordering him to \\\"come along\\\", and lecturing him for his misbehavior. He then disappears, and the two beings follow after apologizing to Kirk, who returns to the ship.\\n\"\n",

Captain Kirk, First Officer Spock, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, and a security force beam down to find one survivor who says the base came under heavy bombardment from an unknown enemy. The landing party find themselves under fire from nearby, with two of the security team killed in the initial volley. The Enterprise is also under attack from an unknown vessel, preventing the crew from beaming up the landing party. On the surface, Kirk finds a grenade launcher from the outpost's stores, and uses it to scatter the alien forces. The alien ship recovers its crew from the surface and begins to retreat. The landing party is beamed back aboard Enterprise before they give chase.\\nBoth ships enter an unexplored sector of space, and shortly thereafter, lose all propulsion power. Enterprise is contacted by a species calling themselves the Metrons (voiced by Vic Perrin), who zealously guard their sector of space from intrusion. They announce that they will pit the respective captains against each other in \\\"trial by combat\\\", a one-to-one battle to the death, with the ship of the losing captain to be destroyed and the other ship free to leave. Captain Kirk is suddenly transported to the surface of a rocky, barren planet along with the captain of the other ship, who is of a reptilian species known as the Gorn (voiced by Ted Cassidy). The Metrons speak to Kirk, explaining that while neither captain has communication with his ship, each has been given a vocal recording device that will translate their words to the opposing captain as well as transmit them to their ships. Kirk is told that the planet has numerous resources either captain can use to defeat the other. Aboard Enterprise, the crew are allowed to watch Kirk's actions.\\nKirk attempts to communicate with the Gorn, but receives no response. The Gorn tracks down Kirk, and Kirk realizes he is outmatched physically and relies on his agility to outrun the Gorn. Kirk gets caught in a rope trap set by the Gorn that injures his leg and slows him down. The Gorn finally communicates with Kirk via the translation device and offers to put him out of his misery. Kirk accuses the Gorns of being butchers, but the alien defends their attack on Cestus III, stating the outpost had been built in what the Gorns considered to be their territory. They viewed the Federation's presence in this part of space as an intrusion and a possible prelude to full-scale invasion.\\nTrying to stay ahead of the Gorn, Kirk discovers numerous valuable minerals and resources on the planet, seemingly useless at this point. He is inspired upon finding stalks of bamboo and raw chemicals that can be mixed into a black powder formula. He constructs a makeshift weapon, using chunks of diamond as ammunition. Kirk lies in wait for the Gorn and fires on him, severely wounding him. As Kirk prepares to deal a death blow, he considers the Gorn's claims that the attack on Cestus III was only in self-defense, and allows him to live. Suddenly, the Gorn disappears, and a Metron (Carole Shelyne) appears to Kirk, congratulating him on not only winning the battle but showing the advanced trait of mercy for one's enemy. Kirk refuses to let the Metrons destroy the Gorn ship, leading the Metron to comment that \\\"you are still half savage, but there is hope\\\", and that the Federation should seek out the Metrons again in several thousand years time. Suddenly Kirk finds himself back aboard Enterprise, his injuries healed, and the crew finds itself 500 parsecs from Metron space, the Gorn ship nowhere in range.\\n\"\n",

Sulu when the Enterprise is rocked by a time distortion and McCoy accidentally injects himself with an overdose of cordrazine, a dangerous drug. Delusional and paranoid, McCoy flees from the bridge to the transporter room, beaming himself down to the planet below. Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) leads a landing party to look for McCoy, and they come across an ancient glowing stone archway, which turns out to be the cause of the time distortions. They discover the archway to be sentient, and this \\\"Guardian of Forever\\\" (voiced by Bartell LaRue) explains that it is a doorway to any time and place. While Spock (Leonard Nimoy) is recording historic images from the portal, McCoy escapes through it. The landing party suddenly loses contact with the Enterprise, and the Guardian informs them that McCoy has altered the past, and that the Enterprise, and all that they knew, no longer exists.\\nThe Guardian permits Kirk and Spock to follow McCoy in an effort to repair the timeline. Spock times their passage so as to arrive where McCoy did ahead of when he will arrive, and they find themselves in New York City in 1930, during the Great Depression. After stealing clothes from a fire escape to blend in, they meet a woman named Edith Keeler (Joan Collins), who runs the 21st Street Mission. They are given a place to sleep, along with doing odd jobs to earn money. Spock works to devise a method of interfacing with his tricorder and analyze its recorded images to determine how McCoy has altered history. While they await his arrival, Kirk and Keeler spend time together, and Kirk begins to fall in love.\\nMcCoy arrives, and stumbles into the mission, unnoticed by Kirk and Spock, and Keeler nurses him back to health. Spock completes his work and discovers Keeler was supposed to die that year in a traffic accident. Spock learns Dr. McCoy altered the past by saving Keeler's life and, in the altered timeline, Keeler founded a pacifist movement on the eve of World War II. This causes the United States to delay its entrance into the war, allowing Nazi Germany time to develop nuclear weapons, which they launch in their V-2 rockets to conquer the world. Kirk admits his love for Keeler, and Spock answers that Keeler must die in order to prevent millions of deaths and restore the future.\\nGoing with Kirk to see a movie, Keeler mentions McCoy. Kirk, shocked and excited, tells her to stay where she is and calls Spock to tell him this. The Starfleet trio reunite in front of the mission. Observing this and curious, Keeler crosses the street to join them, and she steps right in front of a fast-moving truck. Kirk turns to save Keeler from the truck, but a shout from Spock freezes him in his tracks. Then Kirk blocks McCoy from saving her and she is struck and killed. McCoy, not knowing why Kirk and Spock did what they did, is stunned and in disbelief that Kirk had knowingly stopped him from saving Keeler.\\nWith history restored, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are returned to the Guardian's planet where the rest of the landing party is waiting. Scotty remarks, as Kirk, Spock, and McCoy return through the portal, that the 3 had only left \\\"a moment ago\\\", even though, for Spock, Kirk, and McCoy, much more time had passed than that. When the Guardian declares that \\\"many such journeys are possible\\\", a brokenhearted Kirk simply states \\\"Let's get the hell out of here,\\\" and the landing party beams off the planet back to the Enterprise.\\n\"\n",

They approach Deneva, a Federation colony where Captain Kirk's brother, Sam, has been stationed along with Sam's wife Aurelan and son, Peter. After entering the system, they try to stop a ship as it dives into the local sun, its pilot raving about being \\\"free\\\" before the ship is destroyed.\\nTransporting to Deneva's main city, Kirk, First Officer Spock, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy and a security detail find the town quiet. A group of men armed with clubs try to warn the landing party away, and then attack. Kirk has the men stunned, but McCoy finds that their brains are still being violently stimulated. The party locates the Kirk family home; Sam is dead (played by William Shatner), while Aurelan (Joan Swift) acts irrationally before passing out and Peter (Craig Hundley) is comatose. Kirk and McCoy return with the survivors to Enterprise, where McCoy finds they are suffering from a condition similar to that of their attackers. McCoy gives both painkillers, and Aurelan wakes briefly to tell Kirk of horrible \\\"things\\\" spreading from planet to planet, using others' bodies to build ships.\\nKirk returns to the planet and joins Spock in search for these entities. They find a number of single-celled creatures attached to the walls and ceiling of one building. The creatures fly, and attempt to attack the humans; the landing party finds they are nearly immune to phaser fire. One makes contact with Spock before Kirk can pry it off, and Spock falls in pain. They transport back to the Enterprise, and McCoy determines that the creature has injected some of its tissue into Spock's spinal column; it will be impossible to remove surgically. When Spock regains consciousness, he attempts to take control of the ship but McCoy sedates him in time. Later, Spock apologizes to Kirk and asserts that his mental discipline can control the pain, but that he must return to the surface to acquire a specimen to study. Kirk and McCoy agree, and Spock, on return to the colony, is able to stun a creature. Returning to the Enterprise, Spock and Kirk determine that the creatures are part of a hive mind. Spock and McCoy fail in their attempts to destroy the creature.\\nKirk holds a senior staff meeting, asserting they must find a solution before the creatures reach the next inhabited planet, holding over a million people; a solution that doesn't kill the hosts. Kirk recalls the ship's pilot stating that he was free before diving into the sun, and suspect the sun's properties may harm the creatures. He realizes that they have not tried visible light as a means to defeat the creatures. An initial test of blinding light results in the death of the specimen in sick bay. Spock then volunteers to be exposed to intense light, without eye protection, to prove that a creature infecting a host can be killed. Though the test is successful, Spock is now blind. Analysis of the initial test shows that only ultraviolet light was necessary to kill the creature. The Enterprise floods the colony with ultraviolet light from an array of satellites, killing the creatures on the planet and purging the parasites from the survivor.  As the Enterprise prepares to leave orbit, Spock reveals that his Vulcan inner eyelids had prevented permanent blindness and that he can see again.\\n\"\n",

Captain Kirk and Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, having witnessed one of their friend's outbursts, agree and Kirk diverts the ship to Vulcan. En route, Kirk receives orders from Starfleet to travel to Altair VI to represent the Federation at the inauguration ceremony for the planet's new president. Though Kirk instructs the crew to set course to Altair VI, Spock secretly changes course back to Vulcan. Kirk confronts Spock, who claims to have no memory of ordering the course change.\\nKirk orders Spock to Sick Bay, where McCoy finds evidence of extreme physical and emotional stress, a condition that will kill him within eight days if not treated. Spock is forced to explain that he is undergoing pon farr, a condition male Vulcans experience periodically throughout their adult life, and that he must mate or die. Kirk contacts Starfleet to request permission to divert to Vulcan but is denied. Kirk disobeys orders, believing that saving the life of his friend is more important than his career.\\nAt Vulcan, Spock invites Kirk and McCoy to accompany him to the wedding ceremony. He explains that Vulcans are bonded as children so as to fulfill the pon farr commitment, and that T'Pring is to be his mate. T'Pring arrives with Stonn, a pureblood Vulcan, whom she prefers to Spock. T'Pau, a matriarch renowned as the only person ever to refuse a seat on the Federation Council, prepares to conduct the ceremony. However, T'Pring demands the kal-if-fee, a physical challenge between Spock and a champion she selects. To everyone's surprise, she chooses Kirk instead of Stonn. Spock begs T'Pau to forbid it as Kirk is unaware of the implications, but T'Pau leaves the decision to Kirk; another champion will be selected if he refuses. Kirk accepts the challenge, only to learn that it is \\\"to the death.\\\"\\nThe two begin combat with lirpa, a traditional Vulcan weapon. Kirk is challenged by Spock's strength and agility, even in his current state, as well as the thinner atmosphere of Vulcan. McCoy convinces T'Pau to allow him to inject Kirk with a tri-ox compound to offset the effects of the Vulcan atmosphere. The battle continues, with Spock eventually garroting Kirk with an ahn'woon. McCoy rushes to Kirk's body and declares him dead, and requests immediate transport back to the Enterprise.\\nSpock renounces his claim on T'Pring, but not before demanding an explanation from her. She explains that she feared losing Stonn in the kal-if-fee. By choosing Kirk, T'Pring would be assured of having Stonn in some capacity regardless of the outcome: if Spock was the victor, he would release her from the marriage (for having made the challenge in the first place), and if Kirk had won, he would not want her either. Spock, now free of the pon farr, compliments T'Pring on her flawless logic, and returns to the Enterprise, warning Stonn that \\\"having is not so pleasing a thing after all as wanting.\\\"\\nAboard the ship, Spock announces his intent to resign his commission and submit himself for trial for killing Kirk, when he discovers Kirk is alive and well in sickbay. McCoy explains that the injection he gave Kirk was a neuroparalyzer drug that merely simulated death. Asked about what followed, Spock states that he lost all desire for T'Pring after he thought he had killed Kirk. Kirk then learns that Starfleet, at T'Pau's request, has belatedly given the Enterprise permission to travel to Vulcan.\\n\"\n",

Kirk tries to shake the ship free, but fails. A humanoid apparition appears on the bridge viewscreen and addresses the ship's crew. Kirk demands that the ship be set free, but the being responds by tightening its grip, threatening to crush the ship until Kirk agrees to the being's demands that the ship's crew be beamed down to the planet below.\\nKirk leads a landing party that includes Lieutenant Carolyn Palamas (Leslie Parrish), who specialties include Greek mythology. The team arrives at what appears to be an ancient Greek temple, where they encounter the humanoid who identifies himself as the god Apollo (Michael Forest). He informs the party that he will not allow them to leave, and renders their communicators and transporter nonfunctional. He indicates that he expects the crew of the Enterprise to worship him as their ancestors had done, and in return promises to provide for all their needs and desires. Kirk refuses.\\nApollo's attention shifts toward Carolyn, angering Mr. Scott, who steps forward to defend her against Apollo's advances. Apollo destroys his phaser and announces he will take Carolyn as his consort. After displaying his power, Apollo appears tired, and vanishes along with Carolyn.\\nKirk and McCoy speculate that their captor was one of a group of powerful aliens that visited Earth millennia ago and became objects of worship to the ancient Greeks. Having crewman Chekov notice Apollo's fatigue, Kirk provokes Apollo to test the limits of his power and allow the landing party to overcome him. Meanwhile, Carolyn learns that Apollo belonged to a group of travelers who exist on love and worship. He is the last of their kind, the others passed away.\\nKirk's plan to provoke Apollo is frustrated when Carolyn intervenes to protect the landing party.

She reluctantly agrees.\\nMeanwhile, Mr. Spock locates the power source for the force field holding the Enterprise, and finds a way to fire phasers through it. Putting her responsibilities first, Carolyn tells Apollo her interest in him is purely scientific, likening him to a new strain of bacteria. Hurt, Apollo invokes thunder and lightning while Kirk orders Spock to fire on and destroy the power source.\\nDefeated, Apollo addresses his fellow gods, admitting that he was wrong, and begging to join them.

Upon arrival, First Officer Spock reports no life readings from any of the 4 billion inhabitants, despite otherwise normal recent communications. The ship's shields are suddenly activated when a meter-long cylindrical object attacks with a powerful energy bolt equivalent to 90 photon torpedoes. Captain Kirk orders return fire, but his weapon's energy is simply absorbed by the object. Following several more incoming attacks, and on the verge of his ship's destruction, Kirk hails the object. After several back-and-forth attempts, the object requests in-person communication with the Captain and allows itself to be beamed aboard the ship.\\nThe object identifies itself as \\\"Nomad\\\", and refers to Captain Kirk as \\\"the Creator\\\". Spock reports that a Nomad space probe was launched from Earth during the early 21st century; its mission was to explore the galaxy and seek out new life, but it had been reported destroyed\\u00a0\\u2013  a report that Spock acknowledges may have been wrong. The current Nomad has mistaken Kirk for Dr. Jackson Roykirk, the scientist who created and programmed the original probe. Nomad's new mission is to seek out and eliminate any \\\"biological infestation\\\" that it deems imperfect, including the entire population of the Malurian star system. Nomad states that its attempt to destroy the Enterprise had not been necessary since \\\"the Creator\\\" was aboard.\\nLeft in the care of a crew member, Nomad escapes to investigate the sound of Lieutenant Uhura singing, which it detects over the intercom. Arriving on the bridge to make inquiries, it asks Uhura to \\\"think about music\\\" while probing her mind, which erases her memory. When Chief Engineer Scott tries to intervene, Nomad kills him, pleading self-defense. Upon learning that Kirk cannot repair Scott, Nomad offers to restore him to life. Nomad heals Scott, but cannot \\\"repair\\\" Uhura's memory loss; Nomad is taken to the brig. Since Uhura's brain was not damaged (only her memories erased), the medical staff proceed to re-educate her (by the end of the episode, Uhura is almost back to normal).\\nTo uncover more information, Spock performs a Vulcan mind meld with the machine. He discovers that Nomad collided with a meteor and was severely damaged. It then wandered through space, finally coming into contact and merging with a powerful alien probe called Tan Ru, designed to obtain and sterilize soil samples from other planets. Nomad partially integrated Tan Ru's agricultural mission directives, interpreting them to mean \\\"sterilize imperfections\\\". The merging of the two probes imbued Nomad with Tan Ru's vast powers, sufficient to destroy life throughout an entire solar system. Kirk compares Nomad's reincarnation to the changeling legend, in which a human child is switched with a fairy child, with the latter assuming the identity of the former.\\nNomad escapes from its cell, killing two guards who attempt to stop it. The probe makes its way to the engineering deck, where it begins to make adjustments to the engines, accelerating the ship beyond its normal maximum warp speed. As Kirk arrives, Nomad tells him that engine efficiency has been boosted 57%; Kirk orders it to reverse the changes since other structures on the Enterprise cannot handle the faster speed. Nomad complies.\\nExasperated by Nomad's prejudice toward imperfect \\\"biological units\\\", Kirk points out that its own \\\"Creator\\\" is a biological unit. Nomad responds that it must \\\"reevaluate.\\\" Kirk orders the probe back to the brig, and it departs under security guard. Spock then suggests to Kirk that admitting to Nomad that he, \\\"the Creator,\\\" is imperfect was probably a mistake. Spock also observes that because Nomad has threatened to return to its \\\"launch point,\\\" the Earth and all its inhabitants are now at risk of sterilization.\\nEn route to the brig, Nomad kills its two security escorts and heads instead to sickbay. After examining Kirk's medical files and verifying his imperfections as a biological unit, Nomad's \\\"reevaluation\\\" is complete. It proceeds to engineering, incapacitates crew members and shuts down the ship's life-support systems, thus rendering the Enterprise habitable for only a short time longer.\\nKirk arrives and again confronts the probe, questioning it about its mission. When Nomad declares that its directive to sterilize imperfections allows no exceptions, Kirk points out that Nomad itself is imperfect, since it has mistaken Captain Kirk for its true creator Jackson Roykirk. He then claims that Nomad has committed two other errors, by not discovering its own mistake, and by not sterilizing itself as imperfect. Nomad begins to analyze the implications of Kirk's claims, a process that causes noticeable stress to its systems. Kirk and Spock carry Nomad in a rush to the transporter room and, with a final command from Kirk to \\\"exercise your prime function,\\\" beam it into deep space. Seconds after transport, an explosion is detected near the Enterprise and Nomad is no more. The episode ends on a humorous note, with Kirk observing that he is proud that his \\\"son\\\" Nomad, having healed Mr. Scott, would have made a good doctor.\\n\"\n",

After inquiring about the status of the mission, Spock orders the bridge crew to prepare a phaser barrage on the Halkans for their refusal to cooperate, then uses an \\\"agonizer\\\" to punish Transporter Chief Kyle for an error.\\nKirk orders the landing party to sick bay so that they can assess their predicament in private. He deduces that the ion storm must have opened a barrier between parallel universes, causing the landing parties in each universe to switch places. They decide to impersonate their counterparts until they can find a way home. Uhura ascertains that Starfleet has ordered the Halkans' destruction unless the Empire's demands for dilithium are met.

When Scott and McCoy join him in his quarters the computer confirms Kirk's hypothesis and provides a procedure to reproduce the transporter accident and return them to their home universe. Kirk also learns that in this universe, his counterpart took command of the ISS Enterprise by assassinating Captain Christopher Pike, and has since committed numerous atrocities. Meanwhile, aboard the USS Enterprise, Spock places their mirror-universe counterparts in confinement, but has not yet determined how to send them home.\\nOn the ISS Enterprise, Scott and McCoy secretly begin work on the engines and transporter. Spock warns Kirk that despite their relationship he cannot support Kirk's aberrant behavior. Kirk defies the warning, releases Chekov from the Agony Booth, and returns to his quarters. There he finds a female officer, Marlena, the \\\"captain's woman\\\"; she assumes his unusual behavior is part of a plot, as their relationship has been cooling of late. Spock interrupts to inform Kirk that he has been ordered to kill him and take command unless Kirk carries out their mission within four hours. Marlena suggests using the Tantalus Field, a weapon concealed in Kirk's quarters. She focuses the device on Mr. Spock, lamenting his imminent demise, but Kirk prevents her from activating it. He reassures her that she is still the captain's woman as he leaves.\\nIn his own quarters, Spock, already suspicious of the landing party, queries the computer about the \\\"classified research\\\" being conducted in Engineering, and decides to confront Kirk again. On the bridge, Uhura distracts Sulu, the security chief as well as the senior helm officer in this universe, from his security board when it signals Scott's connection of warp power to the transporter. Spock intercepts Kirk in the transporter room and leads him at phaser-point to Sickbay, where Scott, McCoy, and Uhura have been waiting. A fight ensues, in which Spock is knocked out by Kirk. McCoy insists on treating Spock, and before they can leave, Sulu arrives with three security guards. Sulu tells them he intends to assassinate Kirk and make it look like Kirk and Spock killed each other, but Marlena intervenes from Kirk's quarters, using the Tantalus Field to vaporize Sulu's henchmen. Kirk renders Sulu unconscious, and Uhura, Kirk, and Scott head for the transporter room, leaving McCoy to follow after tending to Spock. Spock suddenly awakens and forces McCoy into a Vulcan mind meld to learn why the captain spared his life.\\nKirk, Scott, and Uhura reach the transporter room to find Marlena waiting. She asks Kirk to take her with them, but Kirk explains that the transporter is set for four people. Marlena points a phaser at Kirk, but Uhura disarms her.

Spock arrives and announces he will operate the controls. Kirk uses the time remaining before the landing party must transport out to argue for the overthrow of the Empire, which Spock agrees is inevitable. He urges Spock to take command and find a way to save the Halkans. When Spock reminds him of the necessity of power, Kirk reveals the existence of the Tantalus Field. As he transports them out, Spock promises to consider what Kirk has said.\\nKirk, McCoy, Scott, and Uhura beam out, and find themselves back in the Federation universe.

They quickly find the paradise is extremely hostile; they lose three of the security team to a plant that shoots poisonous thorns, a bizarre lightning storm, and an explosive rock. Transporting back to the ship is impossible as an energy field is drawing power from the Enterprise, rendering the transporters inoperable.\\nKirk orders the team towards a primitive village, carefully avoiding the planet's hazards. Along the way, they capture a native of the planet who has been tracking them. The frightened native, Akuta (Keith Andes), says he is the chief of the \\\"Feeders of Vaal\\\". Small antennae on Akuta's head allow him to communicate with \\\"Vaal\\\", acting as the entity's eyes and ears. During this conversation, Chief Engineer Scott reports that the Enterprise is slowly being pulled towards the planet by a tractor beam. Kirk, suspecting a connection with the Vaal entity, asks Akuta to take them to it. Akuta leads them to a rock formation that has a dragon-like head figure on one side. Spock's analysis shows that the entrance is protected by a force field, but appears to lead to an underground complex. Akuta says that Vaal may wish to speak with them later, but in the meantime, offers the hospitality of his village.\\nThe Enterprise crew find the villagers to be young and healthy, like Akuta, but somewhat unsophisticated. The villagers say that Vaal prohibits \\\"touching\\\", as \\\"replacements\\\" (children) are not needed. After a while the villagers are observed \\\"feeding\\\" Vaal with the explosive mineral, apparently its fuel, and the landing party conclude that Vaal is a machine that maintains the Eden-like conditions of the planet, making the inhabitants virtually immortal and rendering most work unnecessary for them. Spock and McCoy argue over the desirability of this system, but Kirk reminds them they need to find a way to free the Enterprise.\\nIn the evening, Chekov and Landon go to a secluded area to kiss, and a young native couple observe and copy their behavior. Vaal is instantly aware, and through Akuta, orders the natives to kill the strangers in the morning. During their attack the last of the security men is killed, but the rest of the crew subdue the villagers and place them in a hut. Landon in particular distinguishes herself in the fight using impressive hand to hand combat skills to disable two of the villagers. Scott reports that an attempt to use all available power to free the ship has failed. Kirk orders his crew to prevent the villagers from feeding Vaal, and instructs Scott to fire the ship's phasers on the rock formation, hoping to drain Vaal's remaining power. Vaal is overloaded and the Enterprise is freed from the tractor beam. Kirk tells a distraught Akuta that his people will now be able to experience normal life.

There they discover the only member of the crew still aboard: the ship's commander Commodore Matt Decker, who is suffering from severe mental shock.\\nAfter McCoy injects him with a sedative, Decker explains that he and his crew had discovered a giant machine, miles long, that used beams of antiprotons to tear planets apart, consuming the rubble for fuel. The attack by Constellation on the machine was ineffective and the ship suffered heavy damage. Decker evacuated his crew to one of the planets of the system, which the machine subsequently destroyed. Kirk theorizes that the machine is an ancient doomsday machine, which must be stopped before it reaches more populated sectors of the galaxy. McCoy and Decker transport to Enterprise, which has taken Constellation in tow, while Scott's damage control team attempt repairs on Constellation's damaged impulse engines, weapons and shields. Kirk attends to Constellation's nonfunctional viewscreen, which, aside from communications from Enterprise, will be his only means of monitoring events outside the ship.\\nEnterprise's first officer, Spock, informs Kirk of the sudden appearance of the so-called planet killer and it begins to pursue Enterprise. As the boarding party prepares to beam back aboard, the machine attacks Enterprise, damaging the transporter and disrupting communications. Decker, now the senior officer on Enterprise, assumes command and orders a phaser attack. The phasers are useless against the machine as its hull is constructed of solid neutronium, and the ship is then caught in a tractor beam which draws it towards the planet killer's maw. Kirk completes his repair of Constellation's viewscreen and is shocked to see Enterprise engaging the machine. Scott has managed to repair impulse engines and recharge one of Constellation's phaser banks, so Kirk uses the crippled ship to approach and fire at the planet killer, distracting it long enough for Enterprise to escape its tractor beam. After repairing the transporter and reestablishing voice communications, Enterprise retreats to a safe distance. Spock relieves Decker of command on Kirk's orders and Decker is escorted to Sickbay. However, Decker subdues his security escort and steals a shuttlecraft. Overcome with guilt because of the loss of his crew, Decker informs Spock he is flying the shuttlecraft straight into the maw of the machine. Despite Kirk's plea for him to return to Enterprise Decker does not deviate from his course and dies.\\nLt. Sulu reports that the shuttlecraft explosion has reduced the planet killer's power output by a small amount. Realizing that this may have been Decker's intention, and hoping that a starship would do much more damage, Kirk comes up with a plan to explode Constellation inside the planet killer. Over Spock's objections, Kirk insists on piloting the damaged starship himself, and Scott rigs the impulse engines to explode with a thirty-second delay before detonation, warning his captain that once the timer is enabled, there is no way to abort it.\\nWith the rest of the boarding party transported back to Enterprise, Kirk aims Constellation at the maw of the planet killer, triggers the timer, and orders Enterprise to beam him aboard.

His open mouth emits an eerie voice, telling Captain Kirk that Enterprise is cursed and must leave the planet immediately, or death will follow.\\nKirk beams down with First Officer Spock and Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy to search for the missing crewmen, leaving Assistant Chief Engineer DeSalle in charge of Enterprise. The landing party comes upon three apparitions that appear as witches, who warn the landing team not to proceed any further. The team ignores the warnings and discovers what appears to be a medieval castle.\\nEntering the castle, the landing party comes upon a black cat wearing a diamond pendant. As they follow the cat, the floor collapses, and the fall knocks them unconscious. When they awaken, they find themselves held in a dungeon. Scott and Sulu soon appear, walking as if in a trance, and unlock their restraints.\\nKirk and the others attempt to overpower them but suddenly find themselves in another part of the castle, with a robed man, Korob, and the black cat, whom he appears to consult for advice. Spock remarks that no life is known to exist on the planet, and Korob admits that he is not a native. The cat leaves the room, and Korob's beautiful colleague Sylvia enters, wearing a pendant identical to the cat's. As a demonstration of her power, by which she claims to have killed Jackson, Sylvia dangles a miniature model of Enterprise over a lit candle, after which the crew of the real Enterprise reports a rapid rise in hull temperature.\\nKirk reluctantly surrenders and offers to cooperate. Korob then surrounds the model of the ship with a crystal prism, informing them that Enterprise has been encased in an impenetrable force field. Kirk and Spock are then led back to the dungeon.\\nAfter a while McCoy appears, in a trance, and leads Kirk back to Sylvia. Sylvia wants to experience human sensations, and appears in various feminine forms to stimulate Kirk's interest. Kirk plays along as he tries to get information. Sylvia tells Kirk that she and Korob are explorers from another galaxy, who wield their power through a device called a transmuter, which gives them control over matter. Sylvia then realizes Kirk is using her, and angrily sends him back to the dungeon. Korob comes to free Kirk and Spock, telling them that he has released their ship, and urges them to leave immediately, as he can no longer keep Sylvia under control. Sylvia, in the form of a giant cat, attacks him. Korob releases his scepter and Kirk picks it up, guessing it to be the transmuter.\\nKirk tells Sylvia that he has the transmuter. He destroys it when she threatens him with a phaser. The castle disappears and Sulu, Scotty, and McCoy return to normal. Looking down, Kirk sees two tiny blue and yellow creatures, apparently Korob's and Sylvia's true forms. Unable to survive without the transmuter, the two creatures die and disintegrate.\\n\"\n",

Norman seals off engineering and redirects the ship to an unknown planet, warning that any attempt to undo his tampering will destroy the ship.\\nWhen the crew arrives at the planet, Captain Kirk discovers that Harry Mudd, an outlaw whom Kirk has encountered previously, is the \\\"ruler\\\" of the androids who populate the planet. Mudd, or \\\"Mudd the First\\\", as he calls himself, informs Kirk that he and the Enterprise crew can expect to spend the rest of their lives there.\\nMudd then recounts his recent adventures. Having broken out of prison and stolen a spaceship that was damaged during his escape, Mudd crashed on this planet and was taken in by the androids. He says they are very accommodating, but refuse to let him go unless other humans are provided for them to serve and study. The Enterprise crew is to serve that purpose.\\nMcCoy notices a darkened glass panel, which Mudd says is a \\\"shrine\\\" to his wife Stella. The shrine contains an android which nags Mudd as his wife did, but stops instantly when ordered to \\\"shut up\\\". Mudd points out the similarity between Kirk's present position and hers.\\nIn response to Kirk's questions, the androids tell Kirk they were built by a people from the Andromeda Galaxy, who were destroyed by a supernova, leaving the robots to fend for themselves. First Officer Spock (Leonard Nimoy) discovers there are over 200,000 of these androids, and concludes that there must be some central control mechanism.\\nThe crew are brought down, replaced by an android crew. They find much to like about the androids' world. Scotty is fascinated by the engineering knowledge they have to share, Ensign Chekov (Walter Koenig) finds the idea of living on a planet full of compliant female androids not too bad, and Lt. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) is tempted by the offer of immortality in an android body. Kirk will have none of this, however, and reminds them of their duty.\\nMudd plans to depart aboard Enterprise after a final farewell to the Stella android. However, the androids refuse his orders to beam him aboard. They have a different plan: they will leave the planet themselves and offer their services to humanity, with the eventual goal of bringing the greedy and aggressive human race under their control.\\nAs the Enterprise crew discuss their predicament, Spock notes that all of the androids belong to various named series, except for the one named Norman. Kirk relates that one android called on Norman to \\\"coordinate\\\" the analysis of an \\\"illogical\\\" statement. Spock concludes that Norman is the central locus of a composite android mind, and Kirk suggests that \\\"wild, irrational illogic aimed right at Norman\\\" could be a potent weapon against that mind.\\nThe crew then attempt to confuse the androids by means of contradictory statements and a series of bizarre theatrics. For the finale, Mudd and Kirk pose the liar paradox to Norman: Kirk claims everything Mudd says is a lie; and Mudd says to Norman, \\\"Now listen to this carefully, Norman. I am ... lying.\\\" Unable to resolve the contradiction, Norman burns out, causing the other androids to shut down as well.\\nThe androids are reprogrammed to return to their original tasks of making the planet productive. Mudd is informed that he has been paroled to the android population as an example of a human failure, and that a special android has been programmed to see to his needs as an incentive to Mudd to work with the androids and not exploit them. Mudd is grateful until he discovers that this android is the Stella android, and there are now at least 500 copies of her \\u2013 none of whom respond to his command to \\\"shut up\\\".\\n\"\n",

A glowing energy field appears in the shuttlecraft's path, and pulls it down to a nearby planetoid with an Earth-type atmosphere. All communications are blocked, and the shuttlecraft is totally inoperable.\\nSoon afterward, a young man calling himself Cochrane appears. He tells the party that he has been marooned on the planet for years and that a damping field is preventing their systems from working. Cochrane takes them to a shelter built from material salvaged from his crashed ship. In the course of their visit, Kirk and Spock and Dr. McCoy notice a glowing mass resembling the phenomenon that brought them to the planetoid. Cochrane calls this entity \\\"the Companion\\\", and explains that as an old man, he took one last flight, intending to die in space, but his crippled ship was intercepted and rescued by the entity, which restored him to youth and has been keeping him alive since. The Starfleet officers are stunned to discover that he is Zefram Cochrane, the inventor of warp drive. Cochrane then reveals why they were brought to the planetoid: he had told the Companion that he would die without the company of his own kind, believing it would release him. Instead, the Companion hijacked the shuttle.\\nWhen the Companion attacks Spock as he works on the shuttle, Spock deduces that the entity is largely composed of electrical energy. Kirk and Spock attempt to disable the Companion with an improvised electrical disruptor, but the Companion retaliates violently, and only Cochrane's intervention saves Kirk and Spock from being killed.\\nWith Hedford's condition rapidly deteriorating, Spock modifies the shuttle's universal translator to communicate with the energy force. Kirk discovers it has a female personality and is in love with Cochrane. The Companion declares that it has stopped all of them from aging, and will keep them there forever as company for Cochrane. Cochrane, for his part, is disgusted by the idea of an intimate relationship with an alien, rejecting the idea of the Companion's love and affection for him. The dying Hedford, on the other hand, expresses her yearning to love and be loved before dying.\\nCochrane summons the Companion again, and Kirk explains that it and Cochrane are too different for true love. The Companion hypothesizes about being human and disappears. Moments later, Hedford appears outside the shelter, completely restored to health, and they realize that the Companion has merged with Hedford within Hedford's body, which would otherwise have died within moments. In this way both Hedford and the Companion can experience love. Cochrane excitedly talks about his plans for traveling the galaxy, but the Companion/Hedford reveals that its life-force is bound to the planetoid; it cannot leave for more than a few days, so Cochrane chooses to remain with her out of love for her and gratitude, declaring that they will \\u201chave many years\\u201c together. Cochran then requests that Kirk and his crew refrain from informing anyone about his presence on the asteroid so that he and the Companion/Hedford can be left in peace. When McCoy asks who will complete Nancy Hedford's mission, Kirk shrugs and says, \\\"I'm sure the Federation can find another woman, somewhere, who'll stop that war.\\\"\\n\"\n",

The system is a prime source of dilithium crystals, but is underpopulated and unprotected, a situation that some would prefer to maintain by keeping Coridan out of the Federation.\\nSarek, who is a Vulcan ambassador, boards the ship with his human wife Amanda, ignoring Spock's greeting. Captain Kirk learns that Sarek is in fact Spock's father, now estranged because he disapproved of his son's decision to join Starfleet rather than attend the Vulcan Science Academy.\\nDuring a reception for the passengers, the Tellarite ambassador, Gav, demands to know Sarek's position on Coridan. Pushed for a response, Sarek refers to the need to protect Coridan from unauthorized mining operations, with which Tellarite ships have been involved. Gav takes offense at the allegation and the confrontation briefly becomes physical before Kirk intervenes, warning all parties to keep order on his ship.\\nMeanwhile, Communications Officer Lt. Uhura has detected an encoded transmission beamed from Enterprise to a fast-moving vessel at the extreme edge of sensor range. Shortly afterward, Ambassador Gav is found murdered, his neck broken by what Spock describes as an ancient Vulcan method of execution called Tal-Shaya, casting suspicion on Sarek. During questioning, Sarek suffers a cardiovascular event, and is rushed to the sickbay, where Chief Medical Officer McCoy determines that he requires immediate surgery. Because there is a shortage of his rare T-negative-type blood, Spock volunteers to donate some of his own blood for the operation, using an experimental stimulant for increased blood production.\\nPlans for the procedure come to a halt when Thelev, a member of the Andorian delegation, stabs Captain Kirk. Kirk subdues Thelev but is seriously wounded and taken to sickbay, while Thelev is imprisoned in the brig. In accordance with regulations, and despite Amanda's emotional plea, Spock refuses to continue the blood donation and turn command of Enterprise over to anyone else, as the situation is too critical.\\nHearing of Spock's refusal to relinquish command, and having recovered sufficiently to be able to walk, Kirk returns to the bridge to relieve Spock and order him to the sickbay, intending to turn command over to Mr. Scott. When Uhura picks up another encoded transmission from inside Enterprise and traces the source to the brig, Kirk decides to stay on the bridge. When Thelev is searched, it is discovered that one of his antennae is fake and conceals a small transceiver.\\nThe unidentified vessel closes in to attack, moving too quickly for Enterprise to lock phasers. The ship takes several hits from the attacking vessel. McCoy begins the operation on Sarek, who is receiving blood directly from Spock. Kirk orders Thelev brought to the bridge and questions him about himself and the attacking ship; Thelev is unresponsive. Kirk decides on a ruse, shutting down internal power to make Enterprise appear crippled. The attacker approaches, and Enterprise damages it with a surprise phaser attack. The disabled ship self-destructs, and Thelev reveals that both he and the ship were on suicide missions; he then collapses and dies from a delayed-action poison.\\nKirk returns to sickbay for further care and finds Spock and Sarek both alert, the surgery an apparent success. Spock speculates that Thelev and the attacking ship were of Orion origin, and the speed and power of the latter were consistent with a suicide mission, with all energy dedicated to attack. Thelev's mission aboard Enterprise, Kirk and Spock presume, was to sow distrust among the Federation members and weaken Enterprise prior to the attack. In support of this theory is the fact that Orion has been raiding Coridan, and would profit by selling dilithium to both sides in a war. Amanda asks Sarek to thank Spock for saving his life, but Sarek shrugs and says that it was only logical. Amanda expresses anger at this harping on logic, and Spock, noting his mother's exasperation, asks Sarek why he married her. Sarek replies, \\\"At the time, it seemed the logical thing to do,\\\" and offers Amanda his hand in a ritual gesture of affection.

The Capellans order Kirk and his party to hand over their weapons as the Klingon has done, and despite killing Kirk's security escort for drawing a weapon on the Klingon, treat the party as honored guests.\\nThe Capellans' leader, Akaar, favors the Federation's offer over that of the Klingons. However, another Capellan named Maab challenges his leadership. Fighting breaks out among the Capellans and Maab kills Akaar, winning the title of Teer (leader) for himself.

While a party of Capellans pursue them, McCoy is determined to assist with Eleen's pregnancy, despite her culture's prohibition against physical contact with a Teer's wife. He succeeds in winning her cooperation, but she cannot reconcile herself to bearing the child, who in her culture would belong to no one. McCoy tells her to repeat the words \\\"the child is mine\\\", but she misinterprets this, thinking McCoy is claiming the child as his own.

            "        \"plot\": \"The Federation starship USS Enterprise has been ordered to Sigma Iotia II, where the space vessel Horizon was reported missing 100 years earlier. The ship receives a message from Bela Okmyx, an Iotian, who promises information about the Horizon and invites the crew down to the planet. First Officer Spock notes that their interference in the planet's development could violate the Prime Directive, but Captain Kirk points out that the Horizon's arrival a century ago would have already contaminated the culture. Kirk, Spock, and Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy transport to the planet.\\nThey find themselves in a city fashioned after an American city of the 1920s, and some of the residents appear to be gangsters carrying Tommy guns. Okmyx's men escort the landing party to his offices; en route, they observe a drive-by shooting that kills one of their escorts, but the other continues on as if nothing had happened. They arrive at Okmyx's office, where Okmyx orders his men to make a retaliatory attack against a rival gang led by Jojo Krako. Spock discovers an Earth book, Chicago Mobs of the Twenties, published in 1992, and determines it was left by the crew of the Horizon. The Iotians have modelled their entire society on \\\"The Book\\\", which they regard with near-religious reverence. Okmyx demands the Enterprise crew supply his gang with phasers, and when Kirk refuses, threatens to kill them. The landing party is held while Okmyx uses a communicator to repeat the demand to Chief Engineer Scott.\\nKirk distracts their guards by intruding on their poker game and teaching them the fictitious game of \\\"Fizzbin\\\", allowing Spock and McCoy to overpower them. McCoy and Spock flee to a radio station to contact the Enterprise and transport back to the ship, while Krako's men capture Kirk.\\nKrako demands phasers of Kirk as well, offering to cut him in for a third of \\\"the action\\\" in exchange. Kirk offers a peaceful solution, but Krako refuses and confines him, threatening to kill him by slow torture if he doesn't cooperate. Okmyx contacts the ship, informs them of Kirk's capture, and offers to help rescue Kirk if they will help him. Spock and McCoy return to the planet, but are quickly captured by Okmyx. However, Kirk has managed to engineer his own escape, and arrives in Okmyx's office in time to rescue Spock and McCoy.\\nThe three set a plan in motion. Taking suits and hats from Okmyx's men, Kirk and Spock return to Krako's office and gain entrance with the help of a local teenager. Quickly subduing Krako's men, Kirk informs Krako that the Federation is taking over the entire planet, but if Krako helps to maintain order and be a willing agent of the Federation, they will give him a \\\"piece of the action\\\". Krako agrees, but for safekeeping, Kirk transports him to the Enterprise. They then make the same offer to Okmyx, which he quickly accepts. As they prepare for the meeting of all the planet's bosses, Krako's men attack Okmyx's headquarters, but the Enterprise uses the ship's phasers to stun the men as they approach. Both Okmyx and Krako realize that they are at Kirk's mercy, and agree to work for the Federation. Kirk installs Okmyx as the top boss with Krako as his lieutenant, and states that a Federation ship will come by once a year for their 40% cut of the planet's \\\"action\\\".\\nKirk, Spock, and McCoy transport back to the Enterprise where Kirk proposes that the Federation's \\\"cut\\\" be used in a planetary fund to guide the Iotians into a more ethical society. McCoy reveals that he left his communicator on the planet. Kirk and Spock note that the Iotians will analyse the technology. Kirk amusingly states that the Iotians may one day be in a position to demand \\\"a piece of our action!\\\"\\n\"\n",

            "        \"plot\": \"The Federation starship USS Enterprise receives a garbled message from Starfleet mentioning the USS Intrepid, a Federation starship crewed entirely by Vulcans. First Officer Spock suddenly looks shocked and announces that he has felt the Intrepid \\\"die\\\". Starfleet then succeeds in making contact, and orders Captain Kirk to investigate the Gamma 7A system, the last known position of the Intrepid. Ensign Chekov reports that the sensors show no life readings in the system of a billion inhabitants.\\nMeanwhile, Spock is examined by Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy in sickbay, where he explains he felt the combined shock and terror in the minds of 400 of his fellow Vulcans aboard the Intrepid as they died. McCoy is amazed that Spock felt anything over the distance involved, but admits there is a lot about Vulcans he still doesn't understand.\\nSpock returns to the bridge just as Lt. Uhura announces she has lost contact with Starfleet. Kirk has Spock scan a dark zone that appears on the main view screen. Suddenly, half the crew are sickened or faint. Spock is unable to determine the nature of the zone, but suggests it is some kind of energy turbulence, and possibly responsible for the death of the system inhabitants and the Intrepid crew. Kirk has Chekov launch a sensor probe into the void. The probe transmits a piercing, high-pitched noise before contact with it is lost.\\nKirk orders the ship into the zone, and as it enters, the piercing sound returns and all the stars disappear from the main view screen. Dr. McCoy then reports that the crew are getting worse, and Chief Engineer Scott reports a loss of power. Spock surmises that the ship has entered a sort of negative energy field that interferes with biological and mechanical processes.\\nThe Enterprise appears to be accelerating of its own accord, and the ship's engines seem to be operating in reverse: forward thrust slows the ship down. Kirk suggests that all available power be channeled into a massive forward thrust, in the hope of breaking free of the zone, but the effort succeeds only in bringing the ship to a halt.\\nTheir quarry is finally revealed to be a gigantic, multicolored object resembling an amoeba. Kirk launches a sensor probe into it, which reveals that the object is indeed made of protoplasm, and is alive. McCoy believes that a crewed probe must be sent into the creature to gather the data needed to destroy it, and volunteers himself for the job. Spock insists that he is better qualified.  Kirk is reluctant to send either of them arguing that it would be a suicide mission and that if anyone should go it should be him as the captain.  But Spock points out that Kirk is not a science specialist and is much better served commanding the Enterprise.  Kirk is then forced to choose which of his two friends to send out in the shuttle, with a realistic probability they won't return.  Kirk ultimately chooses Spock, agreeing that he is better equipped to handle the mission. Spock pilots a shuttle through the creature's outer membrane and makes his way toward the nucleus. Eventually, he reports that the creature is ready to reproduce, and suggests a method of destroying it, but the key part of the message is lost. Kirk and McCoy meet to discuss the situation, and Kirk speculates that if the organism is like an invading virus, then an equivalent of \\\"antibodies\\\" is needed to destroy it.\\nKirk takes the Enterprise into the creature's body, and orders Chief Engineer Scott to prepare an antimatter bomb with a timer set for a seven-minute delay. The bomb is fired into the cell's nucleus and the Enterprise backs out using what little power remains. With seconds remaining, Spock's shuttle is finally located and Kirk orders Scott to tow it with a tractor beam. With power levels nearly exhausted, the ship approaches the outer membrane just as the bomb explodes. Both the Enterprise and the shuttle are thrown clear of the organism as it is destroyed. The Enterprise is restored to full power and sustains only minor damage.\\n\"\n",

On the planet, Kirk and First Officer Spock notice a group of villagers apparently preparing for an ambush. Kirk is surprised to see them with firearms, and their quarry seems to be a group of Hill People, one of whom, Tyree, Kirk recognizes. Forbidden to use phasers, Kirk throws a rock toward the villagers, causing one of their guns to go off. A chase ensues and Spock is shot.\\nOnce back aboard the Enterprise, Spock is taken to sickbay. Sensors detect a Klingon vessel in orbit around the planet, and Kirk suspects the Klingons of having supplied the firearms to the villagers.\\nKirk returns with McCoy, both in native dress, to investigate. The two are attacked by an indigenous creature called a Mugato,[note 1] which bites Kirk with its poisonous fangs before McCoy can kill it with his phaser. McCoy is unable to call for help, as the Enterprise has left orbit to avoid detection by the Klingons.\\nA friendly group of Hill People arrive and take Kirk and McCoy to their camp, where Kirk discovers that his friend Tyree is now their leader. Tyree is married to Nona, a Kahn-ut-tu woman who can cure the mugato bite. Nona has been urging Tyree to acquire firearms for their tribe.\\nOn hearing of Kirk's arrival, Nona enters the cave and spies McCoy using his phaser to heat rocks. Nona is intrigued and quizzes Tyree about the mysterious guests. She then proceeds to treat Kirk, pressing a mahko root into his injury with her hand which was cut with a knife just before the ritual began. At the conclusion of the ritual she claims that Kirk is now hers, and Tyree explains that, according to legend, he will be unable to refuse her anything as a result of the treatment. The injuries to Kirk and her hand are shown to be completely healed.\\nWhen Kirk recovers, he asks Tyree about the villagers' weapons. Tyree says he saw them for the first time a year ago and believed the villagers were making them. Kirk and McCoy decide to reconnoiter the village that night. Once there, they locate a forge in which they find a chrome steel drill and virtually carbon-free iron, evidence of outsiders' involvement. Soon a Klingon appears with the village leader, who discuss the manufacture of improved weapons. Kirk and McCoy surprise and overpower them, taking a flintlock weapon and escaping with Tyree's help.\\nThe next day, Kirk shows the Hill People how to use the weapon, but Tyree refuses to handle it. McCoy protests, but Kirk counters that both warring parties must be put on an equal footing if both are to survive.\\nNona tries to seduce Kirk with the help of local herbs. A mugato attacks Nona and Kirk disintegrates it with his phaser. Nona then knocks Kirk unconscious, flees with the phaser, and coming upon a group of villagers, offers them the weapon. Not believing her story, they assault her. When Kirk, McCoy, and Tyree appear, the villagers believe she has led them into a trap, and kill her. The two groups fight and the villagers run away.\\nTyree now demands more \\\"fire stick\\\" weapons to avenge his wife's death. Kirk reluctantly orders Scott to manufacture and beam down a hundred flintlocks for the tribesmen. Scott questions the unusual order, and Kirk answers, \\\"Serpents for the Garden of Eden.\\\"\\n\"\n",

Upon arrival, a telepathic being named Sargon (voiced by James Doohan) addresses Kirk and Spock as his \\\"children\\\", and invites them to beam down to the planet. Kirk, Spock, Dr. McCoy, and Lt. Cmdr. Ann Mulhall beam to a subterranean vault where the voice of Sargon greets them from a luminous sphere on a pedestal.\\nSargon explains that he and two others are the last survivors of their race; their minds, stored in these spheres, have existed here since their planet was devastated by war. Sargon then transfers his mind into Kirk's body and Kirk's mind into the sphere. Sargon explains that he and his companions will need human bodies temporarily, in order to construct android hosts for themselves, and then returns to his orb. Kirk, returned to his own body, declares his confidence in Sargon.\\nBack onboard the Enterprise, the four meet with Chief Engineer Scott to consider Sargon's request, and Kirk convinces the others with a rousing speech about risk. The spheres of Sargon, his wife Thalassa, and his former enemy Henoch, are brought up from the planet. McCoy supervises as Sargon takes Kirk's body again, and Thalassa and Henoch take Mulhall's and Spock's bodies, respectively. When Sargon and Thalassa become exhausted by the strain of the transference, Henoch instructs Nurse Chapel in preparing a serum that will strengthen the host bodies. Chapel notices that the serum in the hypospray designated for Kirk does not contain the correct formula. Henoch confesses that he intends to kill Kirk, and Sargon with him, in order to keep Spock's body. Henoch then erases Chapel's memory of the conversation.\\nManufacture of the android hosts begins. Kirk's body weakens more quickly than the others, requiring additional doses of the serum. Henoch tries to tempt Thalassa into keeping their hosts' bodies, because the android forms will be incapable of sensuality. She in turn tries to convince Sargon, but he collapses. McCoy declares that Kirk's body has died and Sargon is gone. Back in sickbay, McCoy is able to revive Kirk's bodily functions, but has no way to restore Kirk's mind. Thalassa offers to restore Kirk in exchange for McCoy's help in keeping Mulhall's body. When McCoy refuses, she assaults him telepathically, but then has a change in heart and relents. The voice of Sargon commands her, and she realizes that Sargon is using the ship itself as a temporary body. She then informs McCoy that Sargon has a plan, and locks him out of the examination room, after which Chapel marches out of sickbay. McCoy reenters the examination room and finds that Kirk and Mulhall have been returned to their bodies. However, the spheres have been destroyed, including the one that held Spock's mind. Kirk says that this was \\\"necessary\\\", and asks McCoy to prepare a lethal hypospray for Henoch.\\nHenoch, who has taken control of the bridge and is terrorizing the crew, reads McCoy's mind and prevents the injection. Henoch then commands Chapel to use the lethal compound on McCoy. She moves as if to comply, but then injects Henoch instead. Henoch boasts that he can transfer to another body, but finds he cannot due to interference from Sargon. Henoch pleads for mercy, but Spock's body collapses, seemingly in death.\\nSargon tells Kirk that he could not allow this. Spock's and Chapel's bodies glow, and Spock revives. Sargon reveals that the injection was not lethal; it was important for McCoy and Chapel to believe it was lethal so that Henoch would believe it also. Spock's mind had been temporarily placed in Chapel's body.\\nSargon and Thalassa announce that they will not attempt to build host bodies, but will \\\"depart into oblivion\\\" instead. They make a final request: to be allowed to use Kirk and Mulhall's bodies one last time to share a kiss.\\n\"\n",

The Enterprise enters orbit around Ekos and is attacked by a rocket armed with a thermonuclear warhead, technology that is too advanced to be from either Ekos or their neighboring planet, Zeon; two very different planets: Ekos is a warlike/anarchist society-while Zeon is a peaceful advanced society.\\nKirk suspects Gill may be responsible for the introduction of advanced technology, which would mean that he has contaminated Ekosian culture and violated the Prime Directive. Kirk and First Officer Spock decide to beam down to the planet to investigate. Before they transport to the surface, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy inserts subcutaneous emergency transponders, a type of homing device, into the forearms of each in the event they cannot use their communicators.\\nUpon their arrival, Kirk and Spock watch in horror as a Zeon is arrested by Ekosian soldiers dressed as brown-shirted Nazi Stormtroopers. An outdoor video newsreel shows an Ekosian rally featuring huge crowds shouting Nazi-style slogans and waving swastika-emblazoned flags. A female Nazi officer, Daras, is shown receiving a medal of honor; the Iron Cross, Second Class. The \\\"Final Solution\\\" is mentioned, meaning apparently the extinction of all Zeons on Ekos, as a prelude to the entire destruction of Zeon. The broadcast ends with the reporter making a Nazi salute to a picture of the F\\u00fchrer\\u2014whom the shocked Kirk recognizes as John Gill.\\nStartled and determined to contact Gill, Kirk and Spock steal uniforms and attempt to infiltrate the main headquarters, but are caught when Spock's ears are exposed. He and Kirk are tortured until Party Chairman Eneg orders them thrown in a cell for further interrogation. There they meet Isak, the Zeon prisoner they had seen arrested earlier.\\nThe trio quickly engineer an escape using the rubindium crystals from Kirk and Spock's transponders as cutting-torch lasers and retrieve their communicators. Isak takes them to meet the underground resistance led by his brother Abrom. Suddenly, their hideout is raided, led by Daras, in what is quickly revealed as a ruse to test the strangers' loyalty. Daras is actually a resistance member who has infiltrated the government. Abrom explains that Deputy F\\u00fchrer Melakon is actually the de facto leader of Ekos; in turn, Kirk and Spock explain the situation from their perspective, and ask for help in locating Gill. They learn that the \\\"F\\u00fchrer\\\" is to make a speech that evening that will officially launch the \\\"Final Solution\\\".\\nTo gain entrance to the broadcast center, the whole group pretends to be a film crew. They find Gill in a broadcasting booth surrounded by guards, seemingly dazed but beginning his speech. Kirk has Dr. McCoy beam down; he arrives in a cloakroom, where the party is discovered by a security team led by Chairman Eneg\\u2014who surprisingly does not seem to recognize them. After he leaves, Isak explains that Eneg is also a resistance member.\\nSneaking into the broadcast booth, McCoy confirms Gill is heavily drugged. He administers a counteractive stimulant while Spock uses a Vulcan mind meld on Gill, which confirms that Melakon was responsible for Gill's condition. Barely coherent, Gill explains that he initially imposed a form of Nazism/Fascism upon the lawless Ekosians because he believed it to be the most efficient system of government ever devised. The system worked on Ekos until Melakon gained control and twisted it into a tool to wipe out Zeon.\\nKirk makes Gill aware of the extent to which Ekos has progressed toward resembling Nazi Germany. Gill, now lucid enough to speak his own mind, renounces the \\\"Final Solution\\\", cancels the invasion of Zeon, and declares Melakon a traitor. Melakon grabs a submachine gun and opens fire on the broadcast booth, fatally wounding Gill. In retaliation, Isak shoots Melakon twice, killing him. Eneg and Daras, still officially respected party leaders, agree to \\\"stop the bloodshed\\\", and plan to announce the end of the Nazi regime. Eneg thanks Kirk for Starfleet's help, but asks them to leave, saying it is up to the two planets to rebuild themselves.\\n\"\n",

A landing party beams down to locate the source, and promptly finds a humanoid male and female, Rojan and Kelinda of the Kelvan Empire, who immediately paralyze Kirk and the landing party and order Kirk to surrender the Enterprise. Rojan tells Kirk that the Kelvans originate from the Andromeda Galaxy, and have come to find planets suitable for conquest in the Milky Way galaxy. As their own ship had been destroyed by the negative-energy barrier at the galactic rim, they need the Enterprise to make the 300-year return journey. Three other Kelvans transport aboard the Enterprise, and quickly gain control of the ship.\\nRojan orders the landing party to a cave guarded by Kelinda. Mr. Spock uses his Vulcan telepathic ability to lure her into the cave, where Kirk knocks her unconscious and seizes her control belt. Their freedom is short-lived, however, and as punishment Rojan orders the Kelvan Hanar to activate his belt, transforming two of the landing team members to small cuboctahedral blocks of a chalk-like substance. Rojan picks up the blocks and crushes one to dust, killing Yeoman Thompson. He then transforms the other block (Lt. Shea) back into human form.\\nBack in their cell, Spock relates the experience of his mental contact with Kelinda. The Kelvans, it seems, are not humanoid after all, but have taken human form for convenience; they are actually huge creatures with hundreds of tentacles. (So alien were they, and so powerful their minds, that he had been thrown back out of the mind meld.)\\nKirk and Spock decide to try to adapt McCoy's neural scanning equipment into a countermeasure to the Kelvans' paralysis field. As a pretext for beaming back to the ship, Spock feigns illness by placing himself into a deep trance. The Kelvans transport the rest of the landing party and themselves to the ship shortly afterwards.\\nSpock determines that there is no hope of penetrating the paralysis field projector's casing. Instead, he has Scott rig the matter/antimatter system to explode on contact with the barrier if Kirk so orders. Kirk opts not to.\\nOnce the ship has crossed the galactic barrier, the Kelvans reduce all personnel except Kirk, Scott, Spock, and McCoy into chalk-like blocks. Spock remembers more from his mental contact with Kelinda and reveals that the Kelvans in their natural form have very weak senses and emotions, but in their present form they are having human reactions. Kirk decides to use their inexperience with physical and emotional stimuli against them.\\nScott introduces the Kelvan engineer Tomar to alcoholic beverages, McCoy injects Hanar with a \\\"supplement\\\" that is actually a stimulant, and Kirk begins a flirtation with Kelinda, provoking feelings of jealousy in Rojan. Kirk is eventually able to goad Rojan into attacking him, and, in the course of the fight, points out that Rojan is behaving like a human and that his descendants who reach the Andromeda Galaxy will be alien inferiors in the eyes of the Kelvans. Realizing Kirk is correct, Rojan relinquishes control of the ship to Kirk, who then gives the order to return \\\"home\\\" to our galaxy. The world on which Rojan and his people were marooned is suggested as their new home.\\n\"\n",

The ship's logs reveal that the Exeter's crew died from an infectious disease that had been brought from the planet, and that Enterprise's landing party is now infected and must beam down to the planet if they are to survive.\\nKirk's party beams down to the last coordinates stored in the Exeter's computer. There, they discover Exeter Captain Ron Tracey (Morgan Woodward) in what resembles a traditional Chinese village. Tracey explains that he had been on the planet when the disease had ravaged his ship, stranding him. He says he has discovered that remaining on the planet confers immunity to the disease. He then reveals that the villagers he is living with on the planet, known as \\\"Kohms\\\", are at war with \\\"savages\\\" called \\\"Yangs\\\".\\nAfter a Yang attack, Spock investigates the field of battle and finds evidence that Tracey has been helping the Kohms, in violation of the Prime Directive. Kirk tries to contact the Enterprise, but is prevented by Tracey, who tries to justify his violation by revealing that the planet\\u2019s natives are not only immune to the mysterious disease, but have also developed lifespans of over 1000 years.\\nTracey orders McCoy to investigate the secret of their longevity and has Kirk and Spock locked up in a crude jail with two Yang prisoners, one male and one female. Kirk has the male Yang loosen the bars of the cell window, but the Yang knocks Kirk out and escapes with the woman. When Kirk recovers, he and Spock make their own escape.\\nSpock is reunited with McCoy, and modifies some medical equipment, turning it into a makeshift communicator, but Tracey discovers this and destroys it. McCoy and Kirk try to explain to Tracey that they have discovered that the natives' longevity has nothing to do with their immunity to the disease, but Tracey's mind snaps, and he attempts to force Kirk to order more weapons to be sent down from Enterprise.\\nDuring a struggle between the two, Yang warriors arrive and carry everyone back to their village. It turns out that their leader is Kirk's former cellmate, known as Cloud William. During a ceremony to celebrate the Yang victory, Kirk and Spock, discussing the Yang culture, connect the names Yang and Kohm with \\\"Yankee\\\" and \\\"Communist\\\". Spock then conjectures that the history of Omega IV had closely paralleled that of Earth until the former was devastated by a biological war that Earth had avoided. This hypothesis is confirmed when William produces a very old American flag, along with ancient documents from which he recites the beginning of the Pledge of Allegiance in a garbled accent. The Yangs are shocked when Kirk chimes in to recite the end of the Pledge.\\nTracey, in an attempt to save his own life, denounces Kirk and Spock, claiming that they have been cast out of heaven, and points to Spock's similar appearance to the devil as proof. William asks Kirk to prove himself by completing the \\\"sacred words\\\" from another document. Because of the accent, Kirk doesn't understand the words and instead suggests a trial by combat between himself and Tracey. As they fight, Spock sends a telepathic suggestion to William's female companion to activate the communicator, lying near her, which she does.  Sulu thereby learns what\\u2019s going on, beams down with a security team to investigate, and takes Tracey into custody.\\nCloud William now kneels before Kirk as if he were a deity, but Kirk orders him to stand. The second document proves to be a version of the American Constitution. Kirk rebukes the Yangs for forgetting its meaning, and declares that the words were meant not just for the Yangs, but \\\"must apply to everyone or they mean nothing.\\\" William does not fully understand, but swears to Kirk that the words will be obeyed.\\n\"\n",

Commodore Wesley (Barry Russo) explains that the Enterprise will be a test vessel for the M-5 Multitronic System, a revolutionary tactical and control computer designed by Dr. Richard Daystrom (William Marshall). The M-5 is to handle all ship functions without human assistance. While Science Officer Spock is impressed with M-5, Captain Kirk and Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy have doubts.\\nThe M-5 succeeds at its first tasks, performing ship functions more quickly and efficiently than a living crew. However, M-5 also exhibits unexpected behavior, such as turning off power and life support to unoccupied parts of the ship, and drawing increased power for unknown reasons; Daystrom maintains M-5 is working properly.\\nIn its first tactical drill, M-5 defends the Enterprise against mock attacks from Starships Excalibur and Lexington. The Enterprise is declared the victor, and Wesley jokingly refers to Kirk as \\\"Captain Dunsel\\\", employing a Starfleet Academy slang term for a part serving no useful purpose. Kirk is troubled by this.\\nSome time later, M-5 detects the Woden, an unmanned freighter, and attacks with live torpedoes, destroying it. Kirk orders M-5 taken offline, but on attempting to do so, finds it protected by a powerful force field. Chief Engineer Scott orders Ensign Harper to disconnect its power source, but the M-5 creates a direct connection to the ship's warp engines, vaporizing Harper in the process. Spock and Scott attempt a manual override, but discover that the M-5 has rerouted all controls. Spock questions Daystrom on his computer design, and Daystrom reveals that he has imprinted human engrams onto M-5's circuits, creating what amounts to a human mind operating at the speed of a computer.\\nMeanwhile, four of Enterprise's sister ships,  Lexington, Potemkin, Excalibur, and Hood, approach to begin a new tactical drill. Since M-5 has disabled communications, Kirk is unable to warn M-5's targets. M-5 detects the ships, and attacks them with full-strength weapons. The crew watches helplessly as the Enterprise fires on the Lexington, killing 53, and then turns to the Excalibur, killing all aboard and leaving her adrift. Commodore Wesley assumes that Kirk himself is responsible for the attacks, and requests permission from Starfleet Command to destroy the Enterprise.\\nDaystrom, having indicated that the engrams he used were his own, believes he can reason with the M-5, but his conversation with the unit quickly degenerates into a self-pitying lament over his own career disappointments. McCoy warns Kirk that he sees a psychotic episode coming, and as Daystrom begins loudly to proclaim his and his creation's invincibility, Spock subdues him with a Vulcan nerve pinch.\\nKirk then tries to persuade the M-5 to stop its attacks. The M-5 acknowledges Kirk, who asks M-5 what its purpose is. M-5 responds that its purpose is to protect lives. Kirk rejoins that it acted contrary to its purpose by murdering people. M-5 acknowledges that it has committed murder and must therefore die, and shuts itself down. In so doing, it also cripples the Enterprise.\\nHaving received permission to destroy Enterprise, the other Federation ships close in. Since Scott is unable to restore communications immediately, Kirk decides to allow the ship to drift with shields down, hoping that Commodore Wesley will realize that the threat has passed. The gamble pays off as the Commodore orders his ships to stand down at the last moment.\\n\"\n",

            "        \"plot\": \"The Federation starship USS Enterprise is on routine patrol when it finds wreckage of a survey vessel, the SS Beagle. The Beagle was under the command of Captain R. M. Merik (William Smithers), whom Captain Kirk knew during his academy days. First Officer Spock traces the path of debris to a planet in the previously unexplored \\\"system 892\\\".\\nUpon arrival, the Enterprise crew monitors a 20th-century-style television broadcast from the planet showing footage of what appears to be a Roman gladiatorial match. The planet's culture is thus revealed to be a kind of 20th-century parallel to Earth's Ancient Rome. An announcer refers to one of the gladiators as William B. Harrison (who is killed); Spock identifies him from ship's records as one of the Beagle's flight officers.\\nKirk, Spock and Dr. McCoy beam down to the planet to investigate. They are captured and brought before Septimus (Ian Wolfe), the leader of a group of runaway slaves, who asks them if they are \\\"children of the sun\\\". Septimus explains that he was a senator until he heard the \\\"words of the sun\\\" and was made a slave. Although another slave, Flavius (Rhodes Reason), suggests killing the landing party, Septimus decides the landing party poses no threat.\\nKirk reveals that he is looking for Captain Merik, who the slaves suggest is Mericus, First Citizen. Flavius, a former gladiator, offers to help and leads Kirk and his party to the nearby city. They are soon captured and brought before Mericus, who is in fact Merik, and the Proconsul Claudius Marcus (Logan Ramsey), who invites the landing party to sit and talk in private.  Merik explains that the \\\"Beagle\\\" suffered damage and Merik came down to look for ore to repair his ship; he\\nrelates that when he met Claudius Marcus and came to know his culture, he agreed that the planet should be protected from cultural contamination at all costs. Merik decided to stay, putting his crewmen into the gladiatorial matches, where they would be killed (Harrison was called the \\\"last of the Barbarians\\\"). Merik and Marcus try to persuade Kirk to have the Enterprise crew abandon their ship and integrate into the planet's culture. Kirk refuses their demands and instead signals to Chief Engineer Scott, in code, that the landing party is in trouble, but that no rescue attempt should be made.\\nAngered, Marcus sends Spock and McCoy into the televised arena where they must fight Flavius and another gladiator, Achilles. Spock overpowers Achilles and uses a Vulcan nerve pinch on Flavius, ending the fight to a hail of pre-recorded boos and hisses. Spock and McCoy are taken back to the slave pens while Kirk is sentenced to a televised execution scheduled for the next day by the TV Manager aka \\\"Master of the Games\\\". The evening prior to the execution, Marcus sends Drusilla to Kirk's quarters to entertain him and have sexual relations with Kirk. Marcus later remarks to Kirk that he was responsible for Drusilla's visit. As the execution broadcast begins, Flavius rushes forward and is killed trying to save Kirk; Kirk kills the Master of the Games and two guards as well. Marcus orders the remaining guards to kill Kirk; On the Enterprise, Scott uses a low-power phaser burst to cause a power blackout upon the Planet, allowing Kirk to free Spock and McCoy. Merik signals the Enterprise to beam Kirk and party up with a stolen communicator, and is fatally stabbed by Marcus. The landing party dematerializes just one second before the guards open fire with their machine guns.\\nBack on the Enterprise, Spock expresses surprise at a sun-worshiping cult preaching universal brotherhood, opining that sun worship was primitive superstition, with no such philosophy behind it. Lt. Uhura, having monitored the planet's communications all this time, has the answer: \\\"It's not the sun up in the sky. It's the Son of God.\\\" The Captain is astonished: \\\"Caesar and Christ. They had them both. And the Word is spreading only now.\\\"[2][3]\\n\"\n",

A man called Gary Seven (Robert Lansing), dressed in a 20th-century business suit and accompanied by a black cat he calls Isis, materializes on board the Enterprise. Realizing that Captain Kirk and his crew are from the future, Seven warns Kirk that history will be changed if he is not released immediately. Having no proof of Seven's claim, Kirk has him held in the brig. Meanwhile, Spock searches the history database and finds that the United States will launch an orbital nuclear weapons platform in a few hours.\\nSeven, with the help of his pen-sized \\\"servo\\\" device, escapes and beams down to an office in Manhattan, emerging from a vault door hiding a teleporter. Addressing a voice-activated computer, he identifies himself as \\\"Supervisor 194\\\" (code name Gary Seven) and inquires as to the whereabouts of two agents, \\\"201\\\" and \\\"347\\\", who he learns have not been heard from in three days. Seven decides to complete their mission himself. A young woman arrives, whom Seven mistakes for Agent 201, but who is actually Roberta Lincoln (Teri Garr), a secretary employed by the missing agents. Seven then tells Roberta he is a CIA agent, and, appealing to her patriotism, asks her to remain and assist him. The computer eventually discovers that Agents 201 and 347 have died in an automobile accident.\\nKirk and Spock track Seven to his office. Roberta stalls them while Seven and his cat enter the vault and are teleported away. Arriving at \\\"McKinley Rocket Base\\\", Seven gains access to the gantry and climbs onto an access arm to begin rewiring some circuits of the soon-to-launch rocket. When Kirk and Spock pursue Seven to McKinley Rocket Base, they are immediately detained by police. On the Enterprise, Chief Engineer Scott (James Doohan) locates Seven and initiates beaming him up. At the same moment, in Seven's office, Roberta is experimenting with the vault controls and inadvertently intercepts Scotty's transporter beam, bringing Seven to the office.\\nSeven takes control of the rocket remotely, arming its warhead and sending it off course. McKinley Base controllers frantically try to regain control and, failing that, send a self-destruct command to the missile, without success.  After a failed attempt to call the police, Roberta hits Seven with a heavy cigar box and seizes the servo. Seven pleads with her to allow him to proceed, \\\"...or in six minutes, World War III begins!\\\" Kirk and Spock beam to Seven's office. Seven pleads with Kirk to let him complete his plan, which is to destroy the missile at a low enough altitude to deter the use of such orbital platforms in the future. Kirk tells Spock that if he can't destroy the rocket, he will have to trust Gary Seven. Spock replies that without facts, the decision cannot be made logically. Kirk decides to trust Seven who, with only seconds to spare, safely detonates the warhead at an altitude of 104 miles.[3]\\nIn the epilogue, Spock and Kirk explain to Seven that the Enterprise was meant to be part of the day's events, citing their historical records. Seven is curious to know more, but they reveal only that he and Roberta will have an interesting future.\\n\"\n",

When the crew awakens, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy finds Spock in sick bay with his brain surgically removed. Because of his unusual Vulcan physiology, Spock's body can be kept alive in this state for no more than twenty-four hours, giving Captain Kirk that much time to recover his stolen brain.\\nThe Enterprise follows the alien ship's ion trail to the sixth planet of the Sigma Draconis system, a harsh world in the middle of an ice age. A band of male inhabitants attack the landing party, and a captured attacker warns Kirk about the \\\"others\\\", also known as \\\"the givers of pain and delight\\\". Kirk asks about the females of his kind, but is met only with bewilderment.\\nThe landing party is joined by Dr. McCoy, accompanied by Spock's mobile body, controlled by a device McCoy has fashioned. The party travels deep underground and encounters a woman named Luma. When questioned, Luma shows the mentality of a child. Spock's voice is heard through a communicator, but before the conversation goes further, Kirk and his party are captured. The party is brought before the leader of the women, Kara, the same woman who appeared on the Enterprise bridge. Kirk demands to know what they have done with Spock's brain, but Kara claims not to understand what a brain is, exclaiming \\\"Brain and brain! What is brain?\\\"[1] As they try to explain the function of a brain, she realizes that what they are seeking is the \\\"Controller\\\", on which the underground civilization is completely dependent.\\nThe landing party escapes and follow Spock's signals to a control room where his brain has been placed. Kara tells them that the skills needed to remove a brain were provided by a machine called the \\\"Teacher\\\", and that knowledge so obtained lasts no more than three hours. McCoy decides to use the Teacher himself, and then quickly begins the procedure to restore Spock's brain. McCoy's new knowledge begins to fade before the operation is complete, but Spock provides assistance after McCoy reestablishes Spock's ability to speak.\\nWithout their Controller, Kara fears for the women's existence. Kirk assures Kara that the men and women can learn to survive together on the surface. Spock begins a long winded history of the culture of Sigma Draconis VI, much to the dismay of McCoy.\\n\"\n",

Romulan vessels intercept the Enterprise and Kirk negotiates an hour's time to consider surrendering his ship. Kirk, along with the Vulcan First Officer Spock are then invited aboard the Romulan flagship.\\nOnce aboard the Romulan ship, Kirk and Spock are taken before a female commander who demands an explanation for their intrusion into Romulan space. Kirk claims that instrument failure caused the ship to stray off course, but Spock divulges that the captain ordered entry into Romulan space, and asserts that he is insane. Romulan guards lead Kirk to their brig.\\nAlone with Spock in her quarters, the commander questions Spock about his career. She argues that humans may have shown their disregard for his talents and capabilities by not giving him command of a ship, but the Romulans, if he were willing, would not make that mistake.\\nIn the Romulan brig, Kirk injures himself by lunging against the force field door. Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy is summoned from the Enterprise to attend to him. The commander asks McCoy to confirm Spock's characterization of the captain as mentally incompetent and McCoy does so, whereupon the commander calls on Spock to assume command of the Enterprise. Kirk, calling Spock a traitor, attacks him, and Spock defends himself using what he calls the \\\"Vulcan death grip\\\". Kirk slumps to the floor, and McCoy declares him dead.\\nBack on the Enterprise, Kirk awakens from the state of suspension brought on by the so-called death grip. His apparent insanity, the unauthorized venture into Romulan space, and Spock's betrayal have all been part of a secret Federation plan to steal the Romulan cloaking device. Kirk orders McCoy to perform surgery to give him Romulan features and then transports back to the Romulan vessel disguised as one of their officers.\\nMeanwhile, Spock and the commander dine in her quarters, and their conversation grows intimate. When the commander goes to change her attire, Spock directs Kirk, via communicator, to the location of the cloaking device. His signal is discovered and tracked, and Spock surrenders himself to the Romulan officers, but they are too late to prevent Kirk from stealing the cloaking device and returning with it to the Enterprise.\\nChief Engineer Scott attempts to adapt the Romulan cloaking device to the Enterprise while Ensign Chekov succeeds in distinguishing Spock's life signs from those of the Romulans. Both Spock and the Romulan commander are beamed to the Enterprise where Kirk gives the order to return to Federation space. The pursuing Romulans are ready to fire upon them as Scott successfully activates the cloak and the Enterprise vanishes before their eyes. The now-captured Romulan commander points out to Spock that any advantage the Federation gains from studying the new cloaking device model will be temporary, as before long the Romulans will learn to circumvent it.

At that moment, a drowned boy is brought in. Salish, the medicine chief, declares the child dead, but Kirk uses mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to revive him. The elders accept Kirk as a god, forcing Salish to relinquish his position to Kirk.\\nIn the meantime Spock, taking command of the Enterprise, drives her at maximum warp speed to beat the approaching asteroid to the deflection point. However, having pushed the engines well beyond their normal limits, there is not much energy left to deflect the asteroid. The ship's deflectors result in a change of only 0.0013 degrees in its course, which Mr. Sulu tells Spock is insufficient to avert collision with the planet. An attempt to cleave the asteroid like a diamond using the ship's phasers fails, and the attempt damages the warp drive beyond Scotty's ability to repair. Having exhausted their options, the Enterprise heads back to the planet on impulse power to attempt to recover Captain Kirk and devise another solution to the asteroid problem. The trip will take 59 days and according to Mr. Spock, \\\"that asteroid will be four hours behind us all the way.\\\"\\nFollowing the tradition that the tribe priestess and medicine chief marry, Miramanee rejects Salish for Kirk.  Kirk falls deeper in love with Miramanee, though haunted at night by dreams of people he feels he should be with. Miramanee happily tells Kirk that she is pregnant.\\nAs the Enterprise nears the planet, Spock succeeds in partially deciphering the markings on the obelisk. It is an asteroid deflector built by the \\\"Preservers\\\", an ancient race that resettled various endangered humanoid populations on other planets in order to ensure their survival. Spock surmises that the deflector that has malfunctioned.\\nAs the asteroid nears the planet, the sky darkens, thunder roars, and strong winds blow. The elders tell Kirk he must go into the temple to stop the storm. As Kirk pounds fruitlessly on the side of the obelisk, demanding that it open for him, the tribe turns against him. They begin stoning him and Miramanee. Spock and McCoy materialize, frightening the villagers away. Spock uses a mind meld to retrieve Kirk's memories, while McCoy tends to Miramanee's wounds. Kirk is able to open the trap door into the \\\"temple\\\" by speaking the correct tones to open it, and Spock activates the deflector with minutes to spare.

Kollos travels in a carrier to hide him from view, and First Officer Spock assists as necessary using a special visor which allows his Vulcan psychology to withstand the sight of Kollos. Jones is also able to observe Kollos with the help of the visor, a fact which she claims is due to Vulcan-style mental discipline.\\nAt a dinner with Captain Kirk and the senior officers, Jones, a telepath, explains that her assignment is to attempt a mind link with Kollos in the hope of allowing Starfleet to utilize the Medusan's unique senses and navigational abilities.

Sensors detect fractures in space, and a power loss affects all systems. Defiant is found adrift, and Captain Kirk, First Officer Spock, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, and Navigator Ensign Chekov transport across wearing environmental suits for protection. Aboard Defiant, they find the crew dead, apparently having killed one another.\\nThe boarding party discovers that Defiant is slowly fading out of our universe. At one point, McCoy passes his hand through an almost invisible man and a table. With limited transporter functionality due to the unexplained malfunctions, Kirk orders his men to return to Enterprise first. The beaming takes longer than usual, and as Chief Engineer Scott tries to beam Kirk aboard, the Defiant vanishes.\\nSpock determines that the local space is experiencing periods of \\\"interphase\\\", when two parallel dimensions touch each other and objects in one can move to the other, and believes Kirk will reappear during the next one. As he explains the situation, Chekov lashes out in anger, a symptom that McCoy believes is due to their proximity to Defiant. Spock, however, refuses to move the ship, fearful of disrupting local space, which could result in the loss of the Captain.\\nWith two hours before the next interphase, the Enterprise is approached by a small, unfamiliar ship. Its captain, Commander Loskene of the Tholian Assembly, asserts that Enterprise has violated Tholian space and must leave. Spock persuades Loskene to wait one hour and fifty-three minutes. When the time is up, Kirk does not reappear, and Spock concludes that the arrival of the Tholian ship disrupted the interphase.\\nWhen the Enterprise is attacked by Loskene, McCoy again urges Spock to leave, believing Kirk is lost. Spock chooses to return fire and the Tholian ship is disabled, but the Enterprise takes damage as well. Scott warns that because of the damage he cannot guarantee that he can hold their position. A second Tholian ship joins the first, and the two begin weaving an energy web that cages the Enterprise. Spock determines that if the web is completed before repairs are done, they will be unable to escape.\\nSpock conducts a memorial service for Kirk, during which another man goes insane. Spock and McCoy then view a tape left by Kirk, to be played in the event of his death, which implores the two of them to work together for the benefit of the ship. Lieutenant Uhura and Scott both report seeing ghostly manifestations of Kirk. Finally, the apparition is seen on the bridge; Kirk is still in his environmental suit and appears to be urging Spock to \\\"hurry\\\".\\nWith the Tholian web nearly complete, McCoy dispenses an antidote to the effects of the local space, and Spock determines the time of Kirk's next appearance. They lock onto Kirk's coordinates, and Spock orders the activation of the ship's engines, which carries them through the spatial rift to a point 2.72 parsecs away. Kirk is brought along by the transporter lock, and beamed aboard just as his oxygen runs out.\\nOn the bridge, Kirk questions Spock and McCoy about their handling of the emergency, particularly concerning the tape with his final orders. McCoy claims they did not have time to watch it, Spock confirms that they were very busy, and Kirk accepts their answers.\\n\"\n",

The Platonians explain they \\\"lured\\\" the Enterprise to their planet because their leader, Parmen, requires medical help. After being treated by Dr. McCoy, Parmen demands McCoy remain on the planet to treat other Platonians.

McCoy is able to prepare a serum and inject Kirk and Spock with doses to make them have twice the power of Parmen. Alexander asks where does Kirk come from and if size matters. Kirk says size, color, and species does not matter. Alexander asks to go with Kirk.\\nWhile Kirk and the others are waiting for the serum to take effect, Parmen forces the four to perform again.

After a confrontation with Deela's chief scientist Rael, Kirk surmises that the unknown device is intended to turn the Enterprise into a cryogenic storage unit. He records a message to Spock explaining what he has learned; Deela, confident in her people's success, allows this. Their plan, she explains, is to use the Enterprise crew to help propagate their species, whose men have been rendered sterile by the same natural disaster that caused their accelerated state. After a heated debate on the ethics of this plan, Kirk rushes away and disables the transporter.

The landing party is attacked by two aliens, Lal and Thann, from a race of humanoid beings known as Vians, who proceed to injure Kirk. Gem proves she is an empath by absorbing Kirk's injuries, briefly taking them on herself before they are healed.\\nThey search the nearby chambers and find machinery and computer systems, along with transparent cylinders, some containing the missing research personnel in grotesque poses, and three empty ones labeled with the landing party's names.

The Vians then explain that this has all been a test for Gem as a representative of her people in this solar system. They have been trying to judge if Gem was willing to sacrifice her life for that of another; if she passed the test, the Vians would use their advanced technology to save the rest of Gem's people from the pending supernova. Gem attempts again to absorb McCoy's wounds but he pushes her away, not wanting her to die. Spock observes the force field reacts to resistant force, and theorizes that total calm would dissipate the field, allowing them the opportunity to overtake the Vians. Kirk insists to the Vians that Gem has proven her choice is to sacrifice herself, and furthermore accuses the aliens of lacking compassion.

As Petri explains, the Elasian Council of Nobles and the Troyius Tribunal have agreed to marry Elaan to the Troyian king to secure peace, lest the two planets destroy each other. Elaan is a most reluctant bride, cursing an arrangement that she considers a humiliation. Ambassador Petri's mission is to instruct Elaan in the manners and customs of the Troyians.\\nNot long after the Enterprise begins the return journey to Troyius at low impulse speed, a Klingon warship is detected, which paces the Enterprise and ignores all hails. To complicate matters further, Elaan stabs Petri, who refuses to have any further dealings with the Dohlman and vows that his ruler will never marry her. The job of teaching her falls to Captain Kirk.\\nIn Sickbay, Nurse Chapel asks the ambassador why Elasian women are so prized in spite of their savagery. Petri explains that when the tears of an Elasian female touch a man's skin, his heart is \\\"enslaved forever\\\".\\nElaan does not take kindly to Kirk's efforts to educate her and attempts to stab him. He overpowers her, disarms her, and insists that she will learn what she has been ordered to learn. Elaan locks herself in a bathroom and begins to cry, saying she is tired of being hated by everyone. Kirk tries to comfort her, and after wiping a tear from her cheek finds himself besotted with Elaan.\\nMeanwhile, one of the ship's engineers is killed by Kryton, Elaan's chief bodyguard, who then tampers with the Enterprise's warp engines and tries to contact the Klingon battle cruiser. He is captured, but commits suicide before he can be interrogated. Kirk orders Chief Engineer Scott to check the ship's propulsion systems. Elaan reveals that Kryton was in love with her and had been infuriated by the news of the arranged marriage.\\nThe Klingon battlecruiser then begins what appears to be an attack. As Kirk orders the Enterprise to go to warp, Scott reports that, as a result of Kryton's sabotage, any attempt to do so will destroy the ship. As the Klingon passes by without firing, it becomes clear that they were hoping to destroy the Enterprise without an overt act of war. This plan having failed, the Klingons attack in earnest. Mr. Scott reports that Kryton damaged the dilithium crystals in the antimatter reactor control system, making it impossible to go to warp or fire their weapons.\\nIn Sickbay, Ambassador Petri again approaches Elaan and begs her to accept the necklace of Troyian royal jewels that was to be worn at her wedding, as a symbol of the hope for peace between their two worlds. Elaan accepts the necklace and subsequently appears on the bridge wearing it with her wedding dress. Spock detects strange energy readings from some of the jewels, which Elaan describes as common stones, valued only as good-luck charms. The stones are in fact dilithium crystals, which explains the Klingons' keen interest in this star system.\\nThe crystals are taken to Scott in Engineering, where he and Spock work to replace the damaged dilithium crystals as the battlecruiser moves in for the kill.

            "        \"plot\": \"The crew of the Federation starship Enterprise is struck with deadly Rigellian fever, for which the only treatment is the mineral ryetalyn. Captain Kirk, first officer Spock and medical officer Dr. McCoy beam down to the planet Holberg 917-G in search of the substance and are attacked by an airborne robot, which is called off by its master, Flint. Flint demands they leave immediately, but Kirk orders the Enterprise to fire phasers on their coordinates if they are attacked. Acknowledging a stalemate, Flint agrees to let them remain long enough to obtain the ryetalyn.\\nFlint offers the help of his sentry robot M4 to gather the mineral and escorts them to his home, which has an impressive art collection. Spock notices that the brushwork of the paintings is identical to Leonardo da Vinci's, but his tricorder indicates that they are made with contemporary materials.\\nThe party is introduced to Flint's young ward, Rayna Kapec, whose late parents, according to Flint, were employees of his. On Flint's suggestion, Kirk plays billiards with Rayna, and they dance to a waltz played on the piano by Spock. The sheet music, apparently in the hand of Johannes Brahms, is written with contemporary ink. M4 returns with a container of ryetalyn, but it is contaminated with irilium, and therefore useless. Flint apologizes and accompanies M4 on a search for more ryetalyn.\\nWhen Kirk kisses Rayna, M4 reacts as if he were attacking her. Spock destroys it with his phaser. The Enterprise reports that no information can be found on Flint or Rayna. A tricorder scan reveals that Flint is over 6,000 years old.\\nRayna comes to say goodbye to Kirk, who has fallen in love with her and begs her to accompany him. McCoy tells them that after being processed in Flint\\u2019s laboratory, the ryetalyn vanished. Spock follows tricorder readings to a laboratory chamber containing not only the ryetalyn, but a number of android bodies, all labeled \\\"Rayna\\\" and with a different number indicating earlier versions of her.\\nFlint reveals the truth. He was born in 3834 BC, and after falling in battle discovered he could not die. Flint has lived \\\"lifetimes\\\" as da Vinci, Brahms, and many others. He built Rayna to be his immortal mate and manipulated Kirk into teaching her how to love. Paranoid about the possibility that the Enterprise crew would reveal him and his location, Flint causes the Enterprise to disappear from orbit and reappear as a tabletop miniature in his laboratory, with the crewmembers in suspended animation. He proposes to keep them that way for up to 2,000 years. Rayna happens into the room and vehemently objects, so he restores the starship to its previous state. When Captain Kirk professes his love for Rayna and pleads with her to leave with him, a fight breaks out between him and Flint for the possession of Rayna. Rayna stops them, claiming her right to choose her own future, and then, overwhelmed by indecision for fear of hurting either Kirk or Flint, dies.\\nBack on the Enterprise, McCoy reports that readings from the earlier tricorder scan show that Flint has been aging normally since he left Earth\\u2019s environment, and will soon die. Kirk falls asleep on his desk after commenting ruefully on Rayna's fate, and Spock places a suggestion to \\\"forget\\\" into his mind.\\n\"\n",

In trying to escape, the Aurora overloads its engines and its six passengers are safely beamed aboard the Enterprise just as the Aurora explodes. The group consists of Tongo Rad, son of the Catullan ambassador; Irina Galliulin, an acquaintance of Ensign Chekov; Dr. Ton Sevrin, a noted Tiburonian electronics, acoustics, and communications researcher; Adam, a musician; and two other women.\\nIn responses to Kirk's questions, Dr. Sevrin says their destination is the planet \\\"Eden\\\", which Kirk responds is a myth. The group refuses to co-operate with Kirk, but are impressed by First Officer Spock, who is familiar with their social movement. They are persuaded to go to Sickbay for a medical examination which reveals the party to be in good health, except for Dr. Sevrin, who is an asymptomatic carrier of a bacterium. He admits to being aware of this, and believes it to be a product of artificial environments, and tells Spock that the planet Eden will somehow \\\"cleanse\\\" him. Spock attempts to reason with Sevrin and offers to help him find Eden in exchange for his cooperation, but concludes that Sevrin is not sane. Sevrin is quarantined in the brig.\\nThe rest of the group plan to take over the ship. After putting on a music concert, during which Tongo Rad frees Sevrin, the group takes over Auxiliary Control and puts the Enterprise on course for Eden. On arrival at the planet, Sevrin renders all Enterprise crew unconscious with an ultrasonic frequency broadcast through the intercom.\\nWhen the crew regain consciousness, they discover that Sevrin and his followers have stolen a shuttlecraft.[1] Kirk deactivates Sevrin's sonic device, and then joins Spock, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, and Chekov in a search for the group.\\nThe planet surface is lush and beautiful. However, all the plant life secretes a powerful acid, as Chekov discovers when he touches a flower. The team soon finds Adam, lying dead from poisonous fruit. Sevrin and the other survivors are then found in the shuttlecraft, all with burns on their feet. Kirk says they must leave, but Sevrin runs from the shuttle, bites into one of the fruits, and dies.\\nBack on the Enterprise, Irina comes to the bridge to say goodbye to Chekov. Spock advises her and her friends not to give up their search for Eden, as he believes they will either find it, or create one for themselves.\\n\"\n",

Captain Kirk and First Officer Spock beam directly to the zenite mines, where a group of miners, led by a young woman, attempt to take them hostage. High Advisor Plasus arrives with a security force, driving the miners off, and invites Kirk and Spock to return with him to the floating city of Stratos.\\nKirk and Spock are entertained as guests until the zenite can be recovered. They learn Ardanan society is divided between the Troglytes, who perform all physical labor, and city-dwellers who live in luxury. A group of Troglytes known as the Disruptors are rebelling against the elites.\\nWhile Kirk is resting, Vanna, leader of the Disrupters, attempts to take him hostage. Kirk overpowers her, recognizes her as the woman he saw at the mine and questions her. She accuses the Stratos city-dwellers of using the Enterprise to intimidate the Troglytes. Spock and a Stratos security guard arrive, and Vanna is subdued. She is then taken for interrogation under the \\\"rays\\\", which induce intense pain as a form of torture. Kirk is outraged by Plasus's actions and demands the interrogation be stopped. Plasus instead orders Kirk and Spock to leave Stratos immediately and forbids them to return.\\nThe two return to the Enterprise where Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy reports that unprocessed zenite emits an odorless, invisible gas which diminishes mental capacity and heightens emotions. Spock believes that Troglytes serving aboard the floating city have been spared the effects of the gas, enabling them to organize the rebellion.\\nKirk contacts Plasus and offers special masks that filter the zenite gas. Plasus, however, regards Kirk's proposal as unwarranted interference in his government's affairs. Kirk then beams down to Vanna's holding cell, informs her of the effects of zenite gas, and makes his offer to her. Vanna is skeptical at first but appears to trust him, and she and Kirk escape and return to the zenite mines. Once there, however, she orders Kirk seized by two other Disruptors.\\nVanna's friends depart, and she puts Kirk to work digging for zenite. After a short while Kirk attacks her, regains his phaser, and fires at the ceiling of the mine, causing a cave-in that traps them. He then contacts the Enterprise and orders Plasus to be beamed to his location. An indignant Plasus is beamed in, and Kirk forces him and Vanna to dig for zenite. The effects of the zenite gas become apparent as Kirk and Plasus become increasingly irritable. A brawl between them breaks out, and Vanna, finally believing Kirk's story of the gas, signals the Enterprise for help.\\nBack in the city, the zenite consignment is prepared for transport. Plasus has grudgingly allowed the distribution of the filter masks, and Vanna declares that her people's struggle for equality will continue.\\n\"\n",

Impossibly, sensors detect carbon-based life on the planet's surface. The image of Abraham Lincoln drifts toward the ship on the viewscreen. Though skeptical that the figure is the real president, Kirk extends full presidential honors as he transports aboard the ship. Lincoln is human, has no knowledge of technology past the 19th century, but is somehow familiar with the Vulcan philosophy of Nom (meaning \\\"all\\\"). Lincoln invites Kirk and Spock to accompany him down to the planet where an area has appeared with Earth-like conditions. Despite the possibility that the livable conditions are an illusion, Kirk accepts, reasoning that the Enterprise's mission demands they accept any offer of contact with new life.\\nOnce on the planet, Kirk and Spock discover their tricorder and phasers did not transport with them. They are met by Surak, \\\"the father of Vulcan civilization\\\", who died centuries before. A rock-like being with clawed hands and glowing eyes atop a bulbous head, named Yarnek, announces that the inhabitants of the planet wish to conduct an experiment to determine which human philosophy is stronger: good or evil. In this experiment, Earth warlord Colonel Phillip Green, Klingon warlord Kahless, a practitioner of unethical experiments on humanoids named Zora, and Genghis Khan, together representing evil, will be pitted against Kirk, Spock, Lincoln, and Surak (representing good) in a fight to the death.\\nColonel Green offers Kirk an alliance against the Excalbians so that they can all safely return to where they came from, but this is only a distraction for a surprise attack. Kirk and his companions fend off their opponents and run for cover. Kirk and his companions remain resolved that the Excalbians are the true enemy. Kirk attacks Yarnek, but the alien's body is too hot to touch. To force them to fight, Yarnek breaks down the shielding between the matter and anti-matter on the Enterprise, ensuring the ship will explode unless Kirk's force emerges victorious in four hours.\\nKirk and the others begin to manufacture spears. Surak, whose life experiences have taught him that persistent efforts at peace are the best course, obtains permission to go alone to the enemy camp and negotiate. Green's group kills Surak and lures the others in by mimicking Surak crying for help. Lincoln offers to sneak around and free Surak while Kirk and Spock provide a diversion. When Lincoln arrives, he finds Surak's corpse and the waiting Kahless and Green, who kill him.\\nThough now outnumbered two-to-one, when Kirk and Spock confront Green's group in battle, they quickly flee. Despite the conditions of a fight to the death remaining unfulfilled, Yarnek announces that the experiment is over. He concludes that there is nothing different between good and evil because the methods used to fight each other are the same.  Kirk explains that the similar methods of how the two fight each other does not define them as the same.  What defines them is the things for which each of them fight.  The Excalbians allow Kirk and Spock to return to the Enterprise. Though the mystery of Lincoln and Surak remains unsolved, Spock offers the conjecture that the Excalbians, using their apparent ability to transform matter, transformed other living beings into the likenesses of Lincoln and Surak, then tapped Kirk and Spock's minds to create the personalities which they imagined those historical figures had.\\n\"\n",

Surprised to find the surface devoid of humanoid life, Kirk, Dr. McCoy and Spock beam down to investigate. They encounter one last remaining resident, a librarian named Mr. Atoz. Aware of the imminent destruction, Atoz tells the landing party that he will soon escape to rejoin his family. Atoz shows them the Atavachron, a machine with a time portal. They hear a woman scream. Kirk instinctively runs through the portal and McCoy and Spock follow. Atoz tries to warn them that they were not \\\"prepared.\\\"\\nKirk finds himself in a period similar to 17th century England while McCoy and Spock travel back 5,000 years to Sarpeidon's ice age. They cannot locate the portal, but the three are able to speak to each other. Spock surmises that the Sarpeidons have all escaped to their planet's past.\\nThe woman who screamed is a thief, and the policemen who come to arrest her hear Kirk speaking to his friends and suspect him of being a witch. In the jail, Kirk mentions the Atavachron to the interrogating prosecutor. This startles him, and Kirk suspects he is also from the future. Kirk escapes his cell by luring his jailer close and overpowering him. The prosecutor confirms his suspicions but explains that returning to the future would be fatal, since the time travel preparation involves changes to the traveler's biology. Kirk tells him that he went through no such preparation. The prosecutor informs him that an \\\"unprepared\\\" person cannot survive in the past for more than a few hours, just as a \\\"prepared\\\" person cannot survive in the present. The prosecutor leads Kirk to the portal, and Kirk returns to the present.\\nMcCoy and Spock are saved by Zarabeth, a woman who takes them to a sheltering cave. Upon arrival in the past, Spock begins displaying uncharacteristic emotionalism: He continues carrying McCoy when logic would dictate he abandon him, he falls in love with Zarabeth, and he reacts with anger at McCoy's racial slurs. As McCoy recovers from severe exposure, Zarabeth explains to Spock that she too is from Sarpeidon's future, but a tyrant banished her to this era, in which she is the only extant humanoid. She also explains that the Atavachron is a one-way trip. Spock accepts this and becomes increasingly hostile to McCoy's continued desire to return to the present. McCoy accuses Zarabeth of lying about their inability to return because she is desperate not to be abandoned to unending loneliness again, and says that Spock backs her out of emotional attachment. McCoy realizes that being brought 5,000 years into the past is causing Spock to revert to the barbarism of the ancient Vulcans. Realizing the emotionalism of his behavior, Spock asks Zarabeth again about the portal. She admits she doesn't know what the effect of a return trip will be on him and McCoy.\\nBack in the library, despite Kirk's explaining that they are not from Sarpeidon, Atoz stuns him and tries to force him back into the portal. Kirk awakens, overpowers Atoz and forces him to help find McCoy and Spock. Eventually Kirk is able to talk with the two. Unwilling to leave Zarabeth, and still unaware that he will die soon if he remains in the past, Spock tries to send McCoy through the portal alone. However, because McCoy and Spock went through the portal together, neither one can go back without the other. Upon their return, Atoz hurries through the portal to his chosen era. Spock reverts to his normal self, and with little time to spare they are beamed back to the Enterprise.\\n\"\n",

Scott believes that if Spock is acquitted, the \\\"captain\\\" won't let the decision stand, making it necessary to mutiny. \\u201cKirk\\u201d, having monitored their conversation, declares McCoy, Scott, Spock, and \\u201cLester\\u201d guilty of mutiny and condemned to death.\\nOn the bridge, Chekov and Sulu, having witnessed the trial, determine to resist the \\u201ccaptain\\u201d, and refuse to obey his orders. Loudly accusing them of mutiny, \\u201cKirk\\u201d falls into his chair, and an image of Lester emerges from his body, only to return again. \\u201cKirk\\u201d runs to Coleman, who tells him that the transfer is reversing itself, and that Kirk, in Lester's body, must die in order to prevent it.
