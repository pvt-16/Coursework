Fortunately for us, more and more textual data is being standardised to UTF-8 (dominant Unicode character encoding), and the vast majority of web pages are now in UTF-8. An extra win is that Python 3 does everything in Unicode by default, and reads and writes to UTF-8 by default. This means a lot of the time you will not need to worry about character encoding, switching between them, and potentially corrupting text.\n","\n","If the below code does not return 'UTF-8', then you will need to check your Python setup.
